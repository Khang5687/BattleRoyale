# BattleRoyale Circles - Implementation Plan (Vulkan C++ on macOS / MoltenVK)

## Goals
- Vulkan + GLFW app on macOS (MoltenVK) rendering a simulation of image-backed circles (“players”).
- Bouncing physics with circle-circle and circle-wall collisions; health bars; eliminations.
- Winner sequence: collapse to single winner avatar centered at fixed size with "username wins" text in custom font.
- Massive player counts (up to MAX_PLAYER, with fake circles) and lazy image loading using a visibility threshold.
- Display HUD text: "Players left: X" top-left.
- Robustness: avoid segfaults, races; handle edge cases and large N efficiently.

## macOS Vulkan specifics
- Use loader + MoltenVK. Enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` on instance and set `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR`.
- Enable device extension `VK_KHR_portability_subset` and `VK_KHR_swapchain`.
- Validation layer `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` in debug builds.

## High-level Architecture
- App: window, Vulkan context (instance, device, queues, swapchain, render pass, frame sync, descriptor pools).
- Renderer: draw pass for circles, health bars, and text (HUD). Prefer one pipeline for sprites/billboards, instanced.
- Simulation: ECS-lite structs with SoA for hot loops (positions, velocities, radii, health, alive flags, imageId, bias).
- Asset system: image manager with lazy load tiers (fake -> placeholder -> real). O(1) lookup by player index; avoid per-frame traversal costs.
- Collision system: uniform spatial hash grid (or multi-level grids for varied radii). Broad-phase via grid buckets; narrow-phase exact tests. Deterministic resolution order to avoid races.
- Scheduler: single-threaded simulation step; async I/O for image decode/loading. Thread-safe queues with double buffers to apply asset state updates.

## Massive Scale Strategy (1M+ Circles) + Circle-Specific Optimizations

### 🎯 **Circle-Optimized Scaling Strategy for 1M+ Entities**

**Core Insight**: When circles become "specks of dust" on screen, exploit visual irrelevance for computational savings through adaptive simulation tiers.

### **Adaptive Simulation Architecture**
```cpp
class AdaptiveCircleSimulation {
    std::vector<Circle> individualCircles;        // <10k: Full simulation
    std::vector<DensityCluster> mediumClusters;   // 10k-100k: Grouped simulation
    std::vector<StatisticalCluster> dustClusters; // 100k-1M: Statistical simulation
};
```

### **Tier-Based Entity Management System**
```cpp
enum CircleSimulationTier {
    INDIVIDUAL,    // >10 pixels: Full circle rendering + physics
    CLUSTERED,     // 2-10 pixels: Group nearby circles into density blobs
    STATISTICAL,   // 0.5-2 pixels: Statistical cluster simulation
    INVISIBLE      // <0.5 pixels: Position tracking only
};
```

### **Performance Scaling Matrix**
| Entity Count | Rendering Method | Physics Method | Expected Performance |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1-1k | Individual circles + SDF | Full collision detection | 120+ FPS |
| 1k-10k | Individual + simple LOD | Spatial grid collision | 60+ FPS |
| 10k-100k | Density clusters | Cluster-to-cluster physics | 30+ FPS |
| 100k-1M+ | Statistical clusters | Statistical approximation | 30+ FPS |

### **Density-Based Rendering Optimization**
```cpp
// Calculate apparent screen size for dynamic detail selection
float apparentRadius = physicalRadius * zoomFactor / distanceFromCamera;

if (apparentRadius < 0.5f) {
    renderAsPixel(averageColor);        // SUB-PIXEL: Single colored pixel
} else if (apparentRadius < 2.0f) {
    renderAsSquare(color);              // TINY: Simple colored square
} else if (apparentRadius < 10.0f) {
    renderAsSimpleCircle(color);        // SMALL: Simplified SDF
} else {
    renderAsDetailedCircle(texture);    // LARGE: Full detail + texture
}
```

### **Statistical Clustering for Dust-Level Circles**
```cpp
struct StatisticalCluster {
    vec2 centerOfMass;          // Cluster position
    float totalMass;            // Combined physics mass
    vec2 averageVelocity;       // Average movement direction
    uint32_t aliveCount;        // Circles in cluster
    vec3 dominantColor;         // Most common circle color

    // Simplified physics: treat cluster as single large circle
    void updatePhysics(float dt);

    // Statistical elimination within cluster
    void processEliminations(float damage);
};
```

### **Dynamic Tier Promotion/Demotion System**
```cpp
void updateSimulationTiers(float currentZoom) {
    // Promote clusters to individuals when zooming in
    for (auto& cluster : dustClusters) {
        if (cluster.getApparentSize(currentZoom) > INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            promoteClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
        }
    }

    // Demote individuals to clusters when zooming out
    for (auto& circle : individualCircles) {
        if (circle.getApparentSize(currentZoom) < CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            demoteToCluster(circle);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Battle Royale Elimination Cascading**
```cpp
// Natural entity count reduction over time
if (cluster.aliveCount < CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD) {
    // Small clusters break apart into individuals for dramatic finale
    convertClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
}
```

### **Adaptive Performance Thresholds**
```cpp
// Adjust clustering aggressiveness based on performance
if (frameTime > TARGET_FRAME_TIME) {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 1.1f;     // More aggressive clustering
} else {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 0.99f;    // More detailed rendering
}
```

### GPU-Driven Rendering Architecture (2024 State-of-Art)
- **Compute Shader Culling**: Offload frustum, distance, and occlusion culling to GPU compute shaders
- **Indirect Drawing**: Use `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect` with GPU-generated command buffers to eliminate CPU draw call overhead
- **Performance Target**: Real-world 125k objects at 290 FPS rendering 40M+ triangles (RTX 2080 benchmark)

### Multi-Level Optimization Strategy
1. **GPU Culling Pipeline**: Compute shaders perform frustum culling, reducing CPU load exponentially
2. **Hierarchical LOD**: GPU-based distance culling with multiple detail levels based on effective viewport size
3. **Occlusion Culling**: Hi-Z buffer technique using previous frame depth for visibility testing
4. **Mesh Shaders**: Modern Vulkan mesh shaders for 10x geometry pipeline performance improvement

### Spatial Partitioning for Collision Performance
- **Hybrid Spatial Structure**: Quadtree for 2D spatial queries + optimized hash grid for collision detection
- **Performance Scaling**: Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n) for clustered objects
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Efficient add/remove operations as entities move and get eliminated

### Data-Oriented Memory Layout (ECS-Inspired)
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)**: Separate arrays for position, velocity, health, alive flags for cache efficiency
- **SIMD-Friendly Processing**: Contiguous memory layout enables vectorized operations on multiple entities
- **Memory Coherence**: Related data stored together to minimize cache misses during hot loops

### Advanced Asset Management
- Do not load all images or create 500k Vulkan image views. Maintain metadata list of file paths and a small LRU cache of decoded + GPU-resident textures (e.g., few thousands max).
- Use a texture atlas array (array of 2D layers) of fixed layer count (e.g., 2048) for visible, above-threshold players. Evict via LRU when layers are scarce. Index via `imageId -> layerIndex | placeholder`.
- If descriptor indexing (bindless) is absent or limited on MoltenVK, prefer a small set of per-frame descriptor sets for the atlas array; use an indirection buffer mapping instance to atlas layer.
- **GPU-Controlled Loading**: Compute shaders determine which textures to load based on visibility thresholds
- Lazy tiers:
  - Tier 0 (fake): no file I/O; rendered as flat color in compute/fragment; guaranteed to die before threshold.
  - Tier 1 (placeholder): tiny 1x1 or 4x4 texture (low memory) for small-but-visible sprites.
  - Tier 2 (real): high-quality mipmapped texture uploaded on demand when radius > IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD.
- O(1) algorithmic constraint for image access: each entity holds stable index to metadata; atlas layer lookup is O(1) via a dense vector; LRU updates are O(1) amortized with linked-list + hashmap.

### Performance Monitoring & Adaptive Quality
- **Real-time Profiling**: Monitor frame time, draw calls, and memory usage
- **Adaptive LOD**: Dynamically adjust IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD based on performance headroom
- **Quality Scaling**: Reduce texture resolution, disable effects when frame rate drops below target

## Rendering Approach
- Instanced rendering of quads (two triangles) for circles; circle appearance via fragment shader signed distance function to avoid per-vertex circles. Image sampled using per-instance atlas layer; health bar drawn as a second instanced pass or in same shader via a screen-space overlay.
- One command buffer per frame, one draw for circles (instanced), one draw for health bars, one draw for text.
- Push constants or storage buffer for per-frame params (time, viewport, scaling factor, thresholds, counts).

## Scaling Visual Size Without Resizing Massive Counts
- **DEPRECATED APPROACH**: Global scale factor applied to radius causes physics-rendering mismatch and collision issues.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Camera/viewport scaling approach - adjust effective viewport dimensions rather than object sizes.
- Only when an instance crosses IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD do we request real texture; below threshold we render flat color/placeholder.

## Physics and Collisions
- Time step: fixed dt (e.g., 1/120s) using accumulator; decouple from render rate.
- Spatial hash grid with cell size ~= average diameter of common radius tier. For high variance, consider multi-grid (e.g., powers of two radii bins).
- Insert alive circles into grid per frame (SoA helps). Broad-phase: only test against items in same and neighboring cells (9 cells).
- Elastic collision response with damping; apply health damage based on impulse magnitude. Clamp minimum damage to ensure progress.
- Wall collisions via AABB checks; invert velocity component and apply small damping.
- Deterministic iteration order (by index) and atomic-free single-threaded physics step to avoid races. Optionally parallelize by tiling grid regions if needed later with careful conflict management.

## Elimination and Winner Flow
- When health <= 0: mark dead, remove from grid, free/evict texture layer (decrement refcount), decrement alive count.
- Winner: when alive count == 1, transition to "victory" state: interpolate position to center, scale up to WINNER_SCALE, display name (filename stem) in center. Freeze others.

## File/IO and Bias
- Enumerate image filenames from `assets/` once; store stems as player names; maintain mapping for bias damage reduction values (config file `bias.txt` or hardcoded map, modifiable at runtime).
- Bias system: players with bias values get damage reduction (not health/size changes). Applied as: `finalDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f - biasReduction)`.
- Bias only active when player count >= BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default 50) to prevent obvious advantages in small battles.
- MAX_PLAYER: if actual image files < MAX_PLAYER, spawn fake circles to reach MAX_PLAYER; fake circles have Tier 0 textures/colors.

## Constants (tunable)
- MAX_PLAYER
- IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD_RADIUS
- MAX_CIRCLE_SIZE
- WINNER_SCALE
- DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER, WALL_DAMPING, COLLISION_DAMPING
- GRID_CELL_SIZE
- BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default: 50 - minimum player count for bias to be active)

### 1M+ Entity Scaling Constants
- INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 10.0f - minimum apparent radius for individual simulation)
- CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 2.0f - maximum apparent radius for cluster demotion)
- DUST_THRESHOLD (default: 0.5f - minimum apparent radius for any rendering)
- CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD (default: 10 - minimum cluster size before breakup)
- MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE (default: 50 - minimum circles needed to form cluster)
- TARGET_FRAME_TIME (default: 16.67ms - 60 FPS target for adaptive thresholds)

## Robustness and Edge Cases
- Validation layers in debug; check all Vk results; RAII wrappers to prevent leaks.
- Guard zero devices/queues/swapchain formats; handle window resize.
- Clamp velocities/radii; avoid NaNs; ensure no division by zero in collision math.
- Thread safety: image loader thread communicates via lock-free MPMC queue or mutex-protected queue; main thread consumes at frame boundary.
- Prevent thundering herd on texture loads: coalesce requests; deduplicate per imageId; cancel when entity dies.

## Text Rendering (Players left)
- Simple path: bake minimal bitmap font (e.g., stb_easy_font) to a dynamic vertex buffer, or integrate Dear ImGui for HUD (no heavy styling). Keep draw order last.

## 🎯 Hybrid Count + Spatial Zoom System - NEXT IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

**DESIGN GOAL**: Intelligent camera system that combines player count with spatial distribution while maintaining stable, centered zoom that prevents circle clipping.

### 🧠 Core Concept: Smart Zoom with Spatial Awareness

**Visual Effect**:
- **Camera always centers on action**: Zoom focuses on centroid of remaining circles
- **Spatial-aware scaling**: Considers both player count AND how spread out they are
- **No circle clipping**: Zoom adjusts to keep all circles visible
- **Smooth, stable movement**: Interpolated camera prevents jarring jumps

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation Strategy

**Step 1: Camera Centering System**
```cpp
// Calculate centroid of alive circles
vec2 calculateCentroid() {
    vec2 sum = {0, 0};
    uint32_t count = 0;
    for (auto& circle : circles) {
        if (alive[i]) {
            sum += circle.position;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count > 0 ? sum / count : vec2{worldWidth/2, worldHeight/2};
}

// Smooth camera interpolation
vec2 targetCameraCenter = calculateCentroid();
cameraCenter = lerp(cameraCenter, targetCameraCenter, CAMERA_SMOOTH_FACTOR);
```

**Step 2: Spatial Distribution Analysis**
```cpp
// Calculate circle spread (standard deviation from centroid)
float calculateCircleSpread(vec2 centroid) {
    float sumDistanceSquared = 0.0f;
    uint32_t count = 0;
    for (auto& circle : circles) {
        if (alive[i]) {
            float dist = distance(circle.position, centroid);
            sumDistanceSquared += dist * dist;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count > 0 ? sqrt(sumDistanceSquared / count) : 0.0f;
}
```

**Step 3: Hybrid Zoom Factor Calculation**
```cpp
float calculateHybridZoomFactor(uint32_t aliveCount, float currentSpread) {
    // Base zoom from player count (existing system)
    float baseZoom = calculateZoomFromPlayerCount(aliveCount);

    // Spatial adjustment factor
    static float maxObservedSpread = 200.0f; // Track maximum spread seen
    maxObservedSpread = std::max(maxObservedSpread, currentSpread);

    float spreadRatio = maxObservedSpread / std::max(currentSpread, 1.0f);
    float spatialFactor = std::clamp(spreadRatio, 0.5f, 2.0f);

    // Combine factors
    return baseZoom * spatialFactor;
}
```

**Step 4: Updated Shader Integration**
```cpp
// Push constants with camera offset
struct PushConstants {

### ✨ Key Advantages Over Current System

**Spatial Intelligence**:
- **Clustered battles**: Zooms in when circles are grouped together
- **Scattered battles**: Zooms out to keep all circles visible
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Responds to both count AND distribution changes

**Centering Benefits**:
- **No corner zoom**: Always centers on the action, not top-left corner
- **No circle clipping**: Intelligent zoom prevents circles from disappearing
- **Stable viewing**: Smooth interpolation prevents camera oscillation

**Performance Benefits**:
- **O(n) centroid calculation**: Single pass through alive circles
- **Cached spread calculation**: Only recalculated when needed
- **Minimal overhead**: Spatial analysis adds negligible cost

### 🎯 Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Camera Centering (Primary Fix)**
1. Add centroid calculation for alive circles
2. Implement smooth camera position interpolation
3. Update push constants to include camera offset
4. Modify vertex shader for centered transformation
5. Test centering behavior with various circle distributions

**Phase 2: Spatial Distribution Integration**
1. Add circle spread calculation (standard deviation)
2. Implement hybrid zoom factor combining count + spread
3. Add max spread tracking for relative scaling
4. Test with clustered vs scattered scenarios

**Phase 3: Collision Boundary Adaptation**
1. Update effective world bounds to account for camera offset
2. Ensure wall collisions respect camera-centered boundaries
3. Validate collision walls stay aligned with visible edges

**Phase 4: Validation & Polish**
1. Test edge cases (single circle, scattered circles, clustered finale)
2. Performance profiling to ensure O(n) overhead
3. Smooth interpolation tuning to prevent oscillation

### 📋 Technical Integration Notes

**Constants to Add**:
```cpp
static constexpr float CAMERA_SMOOTH_FACTOR = 0.1f;  // Camera interpolation speed
static constexpr float MIN_SPATIAL_FACTOR = 0.5f;    // Min spatial zoom adjustment
static constexpr float MAX_SPATIAL_FACTOR = 2.0f;    // Max spatial zoom adjustment
```

**Expected Outcome**: Intelligent camera system that centers on action, prevents circle clipping, and adapts zoom based on both player count and spatial distribution, providing a superior viewing experience.

### Stage 2 – Dynamic Circle Enlargement System 🎯 NEW IMPLEMENTATION

**Core Concept**: Instead of camera zoom, gradually increase circle sizes and collision radii as players are eliminated, creating natural battle progression from massive swarms to epic final duels.

- ✅ **🎯 Circle Size Scaling Architecture** (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ **Optimal Size Calculation System** — `Simulation::calculateInitialRadius` derives the spawn radius from screen coverage and player count (`src/main.cpp:504`).
  - ✅ **Elimination-Based Scaling Formula** — `calculateTargetRadius` + `smoothstep` compute the global target radius based on elimination ratio (`src/main.cpp:519`, `src/main.cpp:527`).
  - ✅ **Physics-Rendering Synchronization** — `updateRadiusScaling` and `syncRadiusBuffer` keep physics, collision, and instancing data aligned with the evolving radius (`src/main.cpp:537`, `src/main.cpp:559`, `src/main.cpp:595`).

- ✅ **🎯 Smooth Scaling Interpolation System** (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ **Anti-Teleporting Physics** — radius growth is lerped per frame with `RADIUS_SNAP_EPSILON` guards to avoid sudden jumps (`src/main.cpp:562-571`).
  - ✅ **Easing Functions** — inline `smoothstep` shapes the elimination progress curve feeding the radius interpolation (`src/main.cpp:519`).
  - ✅ **Frame-Rate Independent Scaling** — interpolation scales with `deltaTime` via `RADIUS_TRANSITION_SPEED * dt` (`src/main.cpp:565`).
  - ✅ **Collision Boundary Updates** — `updateGridForRadius` retunes the spatial hash grid during init and finale to respect the new radius (`src/main.cpp:388`, `src/main.cpp:544`, `src/main.cpp:752`).

  - [ ] **Integrated LOD System: Circles + Health Bars**
    ```cpp
    enum CircleRenderTier {
        PIXEL_DUST,      // < 1px: Single colored pixel, no health bar
        SIMPLE_SHAPE,    // 1-4px: Flat colored circle + simple health line
        BASIC_TEXTURE,   // 4-12px: Low-res texture + basic health bar
        FULL_DETAIL      // > 12px: High-quality avatar + detailed health bar
    };

    struct HealthBarSpecs {
        bool visible;           // Whether to render health bar
        float widthMultiplier;  // Width = radius * multiplier
        float heightMultiplier; // Height = radius * multiplier
        float offsetMultiplier; // Y-offset = radius * multiplier
        HealthBarStyle style;   // NONE, LINE, BASIC, DETAILED
    };
    ```

## Notes on MoltenVK capabilities
- Descriptor indexing/bindless is limited; plan on atlas array + indirection buffer.
- Avoid geometry shaders; use instancing + SDF.
- Prefer fewer pipelines; Metal backend likes stable pipelines and small descriptor sets.
