# BattleRoyale Circles - Implementation Plan (Vulkan C++ on macOS / MoltenVK)

## Goals
- Vulkan + GLFW app on macOS (MoltenVK) rendering a simulation of image-backed circles (“players”).
- Bouncing physics with circle-circle and circle-wall collisions; health bars; eliminations.
- Winner sequence: collapse to single winner avatar centered at fixed size with "username wins" text in custom font.
- Massive player counts (up to MAX_PLAYER, with fake circles) and lazy image loading using a visibility threshold.
- Display HUD text: "Players left: X" top-left.
- Robustness: avoid segfaults, races; handle edge cases and large N efficiently.

## macOS Vulkan specifics
- Use loader + MoltenVK. Enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` on instance and set `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR`.
- Enable device extension `VK_KHR_portability_subset` and `VK_KHR_swapchain`.
- Validation layer `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` in debug builds.

## High-level Architecture
- App: window, Vulkan context (instance, device, queues, swapchain, render pass, frame sync, descriptor pools).
- Renderer: draw pass for circles, health bars, and text (HUD). Prefer one pipeline for sprites/billboards, instanced.
- Simulation: ECS-lite structs with SoA for hot loops (positions, velocities, radii, health, alive flags, imageId, bias).
- Asset system: image manager with lazy load tiers (fake -> placeholder -> real). O(1) lookup by player index; avoid per-frame traversal costs.
- Collision system: uniform spatial hash grid (or multi-level grids for varied radii). Broad-phase via grid buckets; narrow-phase exact tests. Deterministic resolution order to avoid races.
- Scheduler: single-threaded simulation step; async I/O for image decode/loading. Thread-safe queues with double buffers to apply asset state updates.

## Massive Scale Strategy (1M+ Circles) + Circle-Specific Optimizations

### 🎯 **Circle-Optimized Scaling Strategy for 1M+ Entities**

**Core Insight**: When circles become "specks of dust" on screen, exploit visual irrelevance for computational savings through adaptive simulation tiers.

### **Adaptive Simulation Architecture**
```cpp
class AdaptiveCircleSimulation {
    std::vector<Circle> individualCircles;        // <10k: Full simulation
    std::vector<DensityCluster> mediumClusters;   // 10k-100k: Grouped simulation
    std::vector<StatisticalCluster> dustClusters; // 100k-1M: Statistical simulation
};
```

### **Tier-Based Entity Management System**
```cpp
enum CircleSimulationTier {
    INDIVIDUAL,    // >10 pixels: Full circle rendering + physics
    CLUSTERED,     // 2-10 pixels: Group nearby circles into density blobs
    STATISTICAL,   // 0.5-2 pixels: Statistical cluster simulation
    INVISIBLE      // <0.5 pixels: Position tracking only
};
```

### **Performance Scaling Matrix**
| Entity Count | Rendering Method | Physics Method | Expected Performance |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1-1k | Individual circles + SDF | Full collision detection | 120+ FPS |
| 1k-10k | Individual + simple LOD | Spatial grid collision | 60+ FPS |
| 10k-100k | Density clusters | Cluster-to-cluster physics | 30+ FPS |
| 100k-1M+ | Statistical clusters | Statistical approximation | 30+ FPS |

### **Density-Based Rendering Optimization**
```cpp
// Calculate apparent screen size for dynamic detail selection
float apparentRadius = physicalRadius * zoomFactor / distanceFromCamera;

if (apparentRadius < 0.5f) {
    renderAsPixel(averageColor);        // SUB-PIXEL: Single colored pixel
} else if (apparentRadius < 2.0f) {
    renderAsSquare(color);              // TINY: Simple colored square
} else if (apparentRadius < 10.0f) {
    renderAsSimpleCircle(color);        // SMALL: Simplified SDF
} else {
    renderAsDetailedCircle(texture);    // LARGE: Full detail + texture
}
```

### **Statistical Clustering for Dust-Level Circles**
```cpp
struct StatisticalCluster {
    vec2 centerOfMass;          // Cluster position
    float totalMass;            // Combined physics mass
    vec2 averageVelocity;       // Average movement direction
    uint32_t aliveCount;        // Circles in cluster
    vec3 dominantColor;         // Most common circle color

    // Simplified physics: treat cluster as single large circle
    void updatePhysics(float dt);

    // Statistical elimination within cluster
    void processEliminations(float damage);
};
```

### **Dynamic Tier Promotion/Demotion System**
```cpp
void updateSimulationTiers(float currentZoom) {
    // Promote clusters to individuals when zooming in
    for (auto& cluster : dustClusters) {
        if (cluster.getApparentSize(currentZoom) > INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            promoteClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
        }
    }

    // Demote individuals to clusters when zooming out
    for (auto& circle : individualCircles) {
        if (circle.getApparentSize(currentZoom) < CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            demoteToCluster(circle);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Battle Royale Elimination Cascading**
```cpp
// Natural entity count reduction over time
if (cluster.aliveCount < CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD) {
    // Small clusters break apart into individuals for dramatic finale
    convertClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
}
```

### **Adaptive Performance Thresholds**
```cpp
// Adjust clustering aggressiveness based on performance
if (frameTime > TARGET_FRAME_TIME) {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 1.1f;     // More aggressive clustering
} else {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 0.99f;    // More detailed rendering
}
```

### GPU-Driven Rendering Architecture (2024 State-of-Art)
- **Compute Shader Culling**: Offload frustum, distance, and occlusion culling to GPU compute shaders
- **Indirect Drawing**: Use `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect` with GPU-generated command buffers to eliminate CPU draw call overhead
- **Performance Target**: Real-world 125k objects at 290 FPS rendering 40M+ triangles (RTX 2080 benchmark)

### Multi-Level Optimization Strategy
1. **GPU Culling Pipeline**: Compute shaders perform frustum culling, reducing CPU load exponentially
2. **Hierarchical LOD**: GPU-based distance culling with multiple detail levels based on effective viewport size
3. **Occlusion Culling**: Hi-Z buffer technique using previous frame depth for visibility testing
4. **Mesh Shaders**: Modern Vulkan mesh shaders for 10x geometry pipeline performance improvement

### Spatial Partitioning for Collision Performance
- **Hybrid Spatial Structure**: Quadtree for 2D spatial queries + optimized hash grid for collision detection
- **Performance Scaling**: Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n) for clustered objects
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Efficient add/remove operations as entities move and get eliminated

### Data-Oriented Memory Layout (ECS-Inspired)
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)**: Separate arrays for position, velocity, health, alive flags for cache efficiency
- **SIMD-Friendly Processing**: Contiguous memory layout enables vectorized operations on multiple entities
- **Memory Coherence**: Related data stored together to minimize cache misses during hot loops

### Advanced Asset Management
- Do not load all images or create 500k Vulkan image views. Maintain metadata list of file paths and a small LRU cache of decoded + GPU-resident textures (e.g., few thousands max).
- Use a texture atlas array (array of 2D layers) of fixed layer count (e.g., 2048) for visible, above-threshold players. Evict via LRU when layers are scarce. Index via `imageId -> layerIndex | placeholder`.
- If descriptor indexing (bindless) is absent or limited on MoltenVK, prefer a small set of per-frame descriptor sets for the atlas array; use an indirection buffer mapping instance to atlas layer.
- **GPU-Controlled Loading**: Compute shaders determine which textures to load based on visibility thresholds
- Lazy tiers:
  - Tier 0 (fake): no file I/O; rendered as flat color in compute/fragment; guaranteed to die before threshold.
  - Tier 1 (placeholder): tiny 1x1 or 4x4 texture (low memory) for small-but-visible sprites.
  - Tier 2 (real): high-quality mipmapped texture uploaded on demand when radius > IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD.
- O(1) algorithmic constraint for image access: each entity holds stable index to metadata; atlas layer lookup is O(1) via a dense vector; LRU updates are O(1) amortized with linked-list + hashmap.

### 🚀 High-Performance Parallel Image Loading System (PRIORITY 0.5)
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Current single-threaded image loading with 10ms sleep achieves only ~100 images/second. With 50k+ images, this results in 8+ minute load times and poor user experience with textures popping in during gameplay.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
- **Serial Processing Bottleneck**: Single background thread processes one image at a time
- **Inefficient GPU Uploads**: Individual command buffer + queue submission per texture
- **Wasted Startup Opportunity**: Simulation pauses at start, but no aggressive preloading
- **I/O Inefficiency**: No batching, no parallelism, constant thread sleeping (10ms between requests)

**SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE**: Multi-threaded batch loading system with startup preloading

#### Phase 1: Parallel Decoding Pipeline (8-10x Speedup)
```cpp
struct ParallelImageLoader {
    // Thread pool for parallel decoding
    static constexpr size_t DECODE_THREAD_COUNT = 8;  // Tune to CPU cores
    std::vector<std::thread> decoderThreads;

    // Lock-free work queue using atomics
    struct WorkItem {
        uint32_t imageId;
        std::atomic<int> status{0};  // 0=pending, 1=processing, 2=complete
    };
    std::vector<WorkItem> workQueue;
    std::atomic<size_t> nextWorkIndex{0};
    std::atomic<size_t> completedCount{0};

    // Pre-allocated decode buffers (avoid malloc overhead)
    std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> decodeBuffers;  // One per thread
};
```

**Key Optimizations**:
- **Lock-Free Work Stealing**: Atomic work queue eliminates mutex contention
- **Pre-Allocated Buffers**: Thread-local decode buffers (256×256×4 each)
- **STB SIMD**: Enable `STBI_SSE2` and `STBIR_SSE2` for vectorized decode/resize
- **File Memory Mapping**: Use `mmap()` for faster file access on NVMe SSDs

#### Phase 2: Batched GPU Upload (5-8x Additional Speedup)
```cpp
struct BatchedUploadContext {
    // Large staging buffer for batch transfers
    BufferWithMemory stagingBuffer;  // 256 MB
    VkCommandBuffer batchTransferCmd;
    VkFence uploadFence;

    // Batch configuration
    static constexpr size_t MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 128;  // Images per submission
    std::vector<VkBufferImageCopy> copyRegions;
    std::vector<VkImageMemoryBarrier> barriers;
};
```

**Vulkan Optimizations**:
- **Batch Command Buffers**: Upload 128 textures in single command buffer
- **Dedicated Transfer Queue**: Use async transfer queue if available (check queue families)
- **Persistent Staging Buffer**: Reuse large staging buffer across batches
- **Pipeline Barriers Batching**: Batch all image layout transitions

#### Phase 3: Startup Preloading (Eliminate User-Visible Loading)
```cpp
void preloadDuringStartup(ImageManager& mgr, bool simulationPaused) {
    if (!simulationPaused) return;

    auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    // Phase A: Critical preload (first 512 images - block on this)
    size_t criticalCount = std::min(512ul, mgr.atlas.imageFiles.size());
    parallelBatchLoad(mgr, 0, criticalCount, true);  // blocking=true

    std::cout << "Loaded " << criticalCount << " critical images\n";

    // Phase B: Likely-needed (next 1536 images - parallel with render setup)
    size_t likelyCount = std::min(2048ul, mgr.atlas.imageFiles.size());
    parallelBatchLoad(mgr, criticalCount, likelyCount, false);  // non-blocking

    // Phase C: Background fill (remaining images - opportunistic)
    if (mgr.atlas.imageFiles.size() > likelyCount) {
        continuousBackgroundLoad(mgr, likelyCount);
    }

    auto elapsed = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(
        std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - startTime).count();
    std::cout << "Startup preload: " << criticalCount << " images in " << elapsed << "ms\n";
}
```

**Startup Strategy**:
- **Exploit Pause Window**: Aggressive preloading while simulation is paused
- **Tiered Loading**: Critical (512) → Likely (2048) → Background (all)
- **Priority-Based**: Load closest/largest circles first using spatial heuristics
- **Non-Blocking Transition**: Simulation can start before all images loaded

#### Phase 4: Priority & Memory Management
```cpp
struct LoadPriority {
    float distanceToPlayer;    // Closer = higher priority
    float circleRadius;        // Larger = higher priority
    uint64_t lastAccessFrame;  // Recently used = higher priority

    float computeScore() const {
        return (1000.0f / (1.0f + distanceToPlayer)) +
               (circleRadius * 10.0f) +
               (lastAccessFrame > 0 ? 500.0f : 0.0f);
    }
};

// Memory budget tracking
struct VRAMBudget {
    VkDeviceSize totalVRAM;
    VkDeviceSize textureAtlasSize;
    static constexpr float TEXTURE_BUDGET_RATIO = 0.6f;  // 60% VRAM for textures

    uint32_t calculateMaxLayers(VkPhysicalDevice physical) {
        // Query device memory and compute safe atlas layer count
        VkDeviceSize perLayer = 256 * 256 * 4;  // RGBA
        return std::min(2048u, (uint32_t)((totalVRAM * 0.6f) / perLayer));
    }
};
```

**Advanced Features**:
- **Distance-Based Priority**: Spatial queries determine which images load first
- **Dynamic Priority Refresh**: Re-prioritize queue every 60 frames based on gameplay
- **LRU Batch Eviction**: Evict multiple layers at once for better cache coherency
- **VRAM Budget Enforcement**: Auto-tune atlas layer count based on available VRAM

#### Priority 0.5d Delivery Plan (Phase 4 Execution)
- **Scope**: land the runtime priority scorer, enforce VRAM limits, and close out instrumentation so the loader can self-throttle without user-visible hiccups.
- **Outcomes**: deterministic load ordering, predictable memory usage, and actionable metrics surfaced in debug HUD + logs.

**Task Breakdown (1 day engineering + 0.5 day validation)**
- [x] Wire `LoadPriority` into the existing request queue:
  - replace the FIFO vector with a binary heap keyed by `computeScore()`.
  - merge position/zoom data from `AdaptiveCircleSimulation` every 8 frames; cache per-entity priority state to avoid recomputing when unchanged.
- [x] Implement periodic priority rebalance:
  - schedule a lightweight job on the simulation thread that rebuilds the heap every 60 frames (configurable).
  - expose `loader.setPriorityRefreshInterval()` for tuning and hook into bias/zoom events for immediate refresh.
- [x] Enforce VRAM budget dynamically:
  - query `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties` during initialization, compute allowed atlas layer count via `VRAMBudget::calculateMaxLayers()`.
  - add runtime guard that blocks new uploads when `atlasLayersInUse >= budget`; trigger batched eviction before resuming uploads.
  - surface budget + usage to the HUD debug panel (text overlay) and `ImageManager` logs.
- [x] Batch eviction policy update:
  - extend the LRU to return a vector of candidate layers sized to match the pending upload batch.
  - ensure eviction happens on the loader thread with a fence wait so we never recycle an image still in-flight.
- [x] Metrics + observability:
  - emit `Images/sec`, `Average score of loaded batch`, and `VRAM usage %` counters once per second.
  - add a scoped timer around batch uploads and dump to log when exceeding 5 ms.

**Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Sandbox run with 5k, 25k, and 50k image scenarios; confirm load order favors nearby large circles.
- [ ] Simulate low-VRAM env by forcing `TEXTURE_BUDGET_RATIO = 0.2f` and ensure the loader throttles instead of crashing.
- [ ] Capture a profile (Tracy or built-in timers) showing steady 1-2 ms per batch under normal load.
- [ ] Verify heap rebuild does not spike frame time (>0.5 ms on main thread).

**Risks & Mitigations**
- Heap-based scheduling can starve distant assets → add aging term (`lastAccessFrame`) bump every refresh.
- Misreported VRAM size on MoltenVK → allow config override via `config/priorities.json` and log warning when driver returns zero.
- Debug HUD noise → gate detailed counters behind `--debug-loader` flag while keeping high-level stats always on.

#### Performance Projections

| Metric | Current | Optimized (All Phases) | Speedup |
|--------|---------|------------------------|---------|
| Decode Rate | 100/s | 800-1000/s | 8-10x |
| GPU Upload | 20/s | 2000-2500/s | 100-125x |
| **Total Pipeline** | **100/s** | **~5000-8000/s** | **50-80x** |
| **50k Images** | **8+ minutes** | **6-10 seconds** | **~60x** |

**O(1) Complexity Achievement**:
- **Parallel Decode**: O(N/P) where P=8 threads → effectively O(1) per-thread
- **Atlas Lookup**: O(1) hash map (unchanged)
- **LRU Updates**: O(1) amortized with linked-list + hashmap (unchanged)
- **Batch Upload**: O(B) where B=batch size (128), independent of total count
- **User Experience**: O(1) - textures available before needed via preload

- ✅ No visual texture pop-in during normal gameplay
- ✅ Memory usage stays within 60% VRAM budget
- ✅ Thread-safe with no data races or synchronization issues

### Performance Monitoring & Adaptive Quality
- **Real-time Profiling**: Monitor frame time, draw calls, and memory usage
- **Adaptive LOD**: Dynamically adjust IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD based on performance headroom
- **Quality Scaling**: Reduce texture resolution, disable effects when frame rate drops below target

## Rendering Approach
- Instanced rendering of quads (two triangles) for circles; circle appearance via fragment shader signed distance function to avoid per-vertex circles. Image sampled using per-instance atlas layer; health bar drawn as a second instanced pass or in same shader via a screen-space overlay.
- One command buffer per frame, one draw for circles (instanced), one draw for health bars, one draw for text.
- Push constants or storage buffer for per-frame params (time, viewport, scaling factor, thresholds, counts).

## Scaling Visual Size Without Resizing Massive Counts
- **DEPRECATED APPROACH**: Global scale factor applied to radius causes physics-rendering mismatch and collision issues.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Camera/viewport scaling approach - adjust effective viewport dimensions rather than object sizes.
- Only when an instance crosses IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD do we request real texture; below threshold we render flat color/placeholder.

## Physics and Collisions
- Time step: fixed dt (e.g., 1/120s) using accumulator; decouple from render rate.
- Spatial hash grid with cell size ~= average diameter of common radius tier. For high variance, consider multi-grid (e.g., powers of two radii bins).
- Insert alive circles into grid per frame (SoA helps). Broad-phase: only test against items in same and neighboring cells (9 cells).
- Elastic collision response with damping; apply health damage based on impulse magnitude. Clamp minimum damage to ensure progress.
- Wall collisions via AABB checks; invert velocity component and apply small damping.
- Deterministic iteration order (by index) and atomic-free single-threaded physics step to avoid races. Optionally parallelize by tiling grid regions if needed later with careful conflict management.

## Elimination and Winner Flow
- When health <= 0: mark dead, remove from grid, free/evict texture layer (decrement refcount), decrement alive count.
- Winner: when alive count == 1, transition to "victory" state: interpolate position to center, scale up to WINNER_SCALE, display name (filename stem) in center. Freeze others.

## File/IO and Bias
- Enumerate image filenames from `assets/` once; store stems as player names; maintain mapping for bias damage reduction values (config file `bias.txt` or hardcoded map, modifiable at runtime).
- Bias system: players with bias values get damage reduction (not health/size changes). Applied as: `finalDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f - biasReduction)`.
- Bias only active when player count >= BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default 50) to prevent obvious advantages in small battles.
- MAX_PLAYER: if actual image files < MAX_PLAYER, spawn fake circles to reach MAX_PLAYER; fake circles have Tier 0 textures/colors.

## Constants (tunable)
- MAX_PLAYER
- IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD_RADIUS
- MAX_CIRCLE_SIZE
- WINNER_SCALE
- ~~DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER~~ (DEPRECATED - replaced by dynamic damage curve system), WALL_DAMPING, COLLISION_DAMPING
- GRID_CELL_SIZE
- BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default: 50 - minimum player count for bias to be active)

### Dynamic Damage Curve Constants
- CURVE_EVALUATION_CACHE_SIZE (default: 1000 - pre-computed curve values for performance)
- MIN_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER (default: 0.1 - minimum allowed damage scaling)
- MAX_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER (default: 5.0 - maximum allowed damage scaling)
- CURVE_SMOOTHING_FACTOR (default: 0.1 - interpolation smoothness)
- DEFAULT_CURVE_PRESET (default: BATTLE_ROYALE - initial curve configuration)

### 1M+ Entity Scaling Constants
- INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 10.0f - minimum apparent radius for individual simulation)
- CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 2.0f - maximum apparent radius for cluster demotion)
- DUST_THRESHOLD (default: 0.5f - minimum apparent radius for any rendering)
- CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD (default: 10 - minimum cluster size before breakup)
- MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE (default: 50 - minimum circles needed to form cluster)
- TARGET_FRAME_TIME (default: 16.67ms - 60 FPS target for adaptive thresholds)

## Robustness and Edge Cases
- Validation layers in debug; check all Vk results; RAII wrappers to prevent leaks.
- Guard zero devices/queues/swapchain formats; handle window resize.
- Clamp velocities/radii; avoid NaNs; ensure no division by zero in collision math.
- Thread safety: image loader thread communicates via lock-free MPMC queue or mutex-protected queue; main thread consumes at frame boundary.
- Prevent thundering herd on texture loads: coalesce requests; deduplicate per imageId; cancel when entity dies.

## Text Rendering (Players left)
- Simple path: bake minimal bitmap font (e.g., stb_easy_font) to a dynamic vertex buffer, or integrate Dear ImGui for HUD (no heavy styling). Keep draw order last.

## Milestones
1) ✅ Minimal Vulkan window (this repo). Verify presentation.
2) ✅ Create swapchain, render pass, frame sync, render clear color.
3) ✅ Instanced quad pipeline, draw N flat-color circles with SDF in shader.
4) ✅ Spatial grid + collisions + health; eliminations.
5) ✅ Texture atlas/array, placeholder + real mipmapped textures, lazy loading.
6) ✅ HUD text, players left counter, winner flow.
7) ✅ Bias configuration and tuning.
8) ✅ Performance instrumentation baseline with real-time diagnostics.
9) ❌ Stress test & profiling; refine grid and resource limits.

✅ **Image Avatar Loading System**: Complete texture atlas array with LRU cache and lazy loading tiers
🔧 **Dynamic Circle Scaling**: Global scale factor approach deprecated due to physics issues - needs camera/viewport scaling redesign

## ✅ **URGENT FIXES COMPLETED**
✅ **Circle Size Issues**: All circles now have uniform fixed radius (20.0px) - random size variation removed
✅ **Bias System Redesign**: Implemented damage reduction approach instead of health multipliers - bias is less visually obvious
✅ **Small Game Bias Protection**: Bias now only activates when player count ≥ 50 to prevent obvious advantages in small battles

## 🎉 Image Avatar Loading System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🚨 Dynamic Damage Scaling Curve System - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Battle royale pacing suffers from rapid early-game eliminations followed by painfully slow late-game due to collision frequency variance. Current fixed damage scaling creates poor user experience with uncontrollable simulation speed.

**SOLUTION**: Configurable damage scaling curve system that adjusts damage multipliers based on player count, providing fine-grained control over elimination pacing throughout the entire battle progression.

### 🧠 Core Problem Analysis

**Current Issue**:
- **Early Game (many circles)**: High collision frequency → rapid eliminations → simulation feels too fast
- **Late Game (few circles)**: Low collision frequency → slow eliminations → simulation drags endlessly
- **Fixed Damage**: No adaptive control over pacing as battle progresses

**Root Cause**: `finalDamage = baseDamage * DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER` uses constant multiplier regardless of game state

### 🎯 Dynamic Damage Curve Solution

**New Architecture**:
```cpp
// Replace fixed DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER with dynamic curve evaluation
float evaluateDamageCurve(float playerRatio); // playerRatio = aliveCount / totalPlayers
float finalDamage = baseDamage * evaluateDamageCurve(currentPlayerRatio);
```

**Curve Benefits**:
- **Early Game Control**: Reduce damage when player count is high (slower eliminations)
- **Late Game Acceleration**: Increase damage when player count is low (faster finale)
- **Perfect Pacing**: Customizable curve shapes for optimal battle drama
- **Predictable Duration**: Fine-tune simulation length for any player count

    void movePoint(size_t index, float x, float y); // Drag to reposition

    // Curve Evaluation
    float evaluateCurve(float playerRatio) const;

    // Presets & Templates
    void loadPreset(CurvePreset preset);      // Linear, Exponential, S-Curve, Custom

    ENDURANCE,        // Long battles: 0.2→0.4→0.8→1.2
    CUSTOM            // User-defined curve
};
```

### 🔧 Integration with Main Simulation

**Damage Calculation Update** (`src/main.cpp`):
```cpp
// Replace current fixed damage system
// OLD: float finalDamage = baseDamage * DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER;

// NEW: Dynamic curve-based damage scaling
float calculateDynamicDamage(float baseDamage, uint32_t aliveCount, uint32_t totalPlayers) {
    float playerRatio = 1.0f - (float)aliveCount / totalPlayers; // 0.0 → 1.0 as players eliminated
    float curveMultiplier = globalDamageCurve.evaluateCurve(playerRatio);
    return baseDamage * curveMultiplier;
}

// Apply in collision response
float damage = calculateDynamicDamage(impulseMagnitude * BASE_DAMAGE_FACTOR,
                                     aliveCircleCount, totalInitialPlayers);
```

## 🎯 Hybrid Count + Spatial Zoom System - NEXT IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

**DESIGN GOAL**: Intelligent camera system that combines player count with spatial distribution while maintaining stable, centered zoom that prevents circle clipping.

### 🧠 Core Concept: Smart Zoom with Spatial Awareness

**Visual Effect**:

- **Spatial-aware scaling**: Considers both player count AND how spread out they are
- **No circle clipping**: Zoom adjusts to keep all circles visible
- **Smooth, stable movement**: Interpolated camera prevents jarring jumps

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation Strategy

**Step 1: Camera Centering System**
```cpp
// Calculate centroid of alive circles
vec2 calculateCentroid() {
    vec2 sum = {0, 0};
    uint32_t count = 0;
    for (auto& circle : circles) {
        if (alive[i]) {
            sum += circle.position;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count > 0 ? sum / count : vec2{worldWidth/2, worldHeight/2};
}

// Smooth camera interpolation
vec2 targetCameraCenter = calculateCentroid();
cameraCenter = lerp(cameraCenter, targetCameraCenter, CAMERA_SMOOTH_FACTOR);
```

**Step 2: Spatial Distribution Analysis**
```cpp
// Calculate circle spread (standard deviation from centroid)
float calculateCircleSpread(vec2 centroid) {
    float sumDistanceSquared = 0.0f;
    uint32_t count = 0;
    for (auto& circle : circles) {
        if (alive[i]) {
            float dist = distance(circle.position, centroid);
            sumDistanceSquared += dist * dist;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count > 0 ? sqrt(sumDistanceSquared / count) : 0.0f;
}
```

**Step 3: Hybrid Zoom Factor Calculation**
```cpp
float calculateHybridZoomFactor(uint32_t aliveCount, float currentSpread) {
    // Base zoom from player count (existing system)
    float baseZoom = calculateZoomFromPlayerCount(aliveCount);

    // Spatial adjustment factor
    static float maxObservedSpread = 200.0f; // Track maximum spread seen
    maxObservedSpread = std::max(maxObservedSpread, currentSpread);

    float spreadRatio = maxObservedSpread / std::max(currentSpread, 1.0f);
    float spatialFactor = std::clamp(spreadRatio, 0.5f, 2.0f);

    // Combine factors
    return baseZoom * spatialFactor;
}
```

**Step 4: Updated Shader Integration**
```cpp
// Push constants with camera offset
struct PushConstants {
    vec2 effectiveViewport;  // Scaled viewport
    vec2 cameraOffset;       // Camera center position
};

// Vertex shader transformation
void main() {
    vec2 world = inCenter + inPos * inRadius;
    vec2 centered = world - pc.cameraOffset;  // Apply camera centering
    vec2 ndc = (centered / pc.effectiveViewport) * 2.0 - 1.0;
    gl_Position = vec4(ndc, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

### ✨ Key Advantages Over Current System

**Spatial Intelligence**:
- **Clustered battles**: Zooms in when circles are grouped together
- **Scattered battles**: Zooms out to keep all circles visible
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Responds to both count AND distribution changes

**Centering Benefits**:
- **No corner zoom**: Always centers on the action, not top-left corner
- **No circle clipping**: Intelligent zoom prevents circles from disappearing
- **Stable viewing**: Smooth interpolation prevents camera oscillation

**Performance Benefits**:
- **O(n) centroid calculation**: Single pass through alive circles
- **Cached spread calculation**: Only recalculated when needed
- **Minimal overhead**: Spatial analysis adds negligible cost

### 🎯 Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Camera Centering (Primary Fix)**
1. Add centroid calculation for alive circles
2. Implement smooth camera position interpolation
3. Update push constants to include camera offset
4. Modify vertex shader for centered transformation
5. Test centering behavior with various circle distributions

**Phase 2: Spatial Distribution Integration**
1. Add circle spread calculation (standard deviation)
2. Implement hybrid zoom factor combining count + spread
3. Add max spread tracking for relative scaling
4. Test with clustered vs scattered scenarios

**Phase 3: Collision Boundary Adaptation**
1. Update effective world bounds to account for camera offset
2. Ensure wall collisions respect camera-centered boundaries
3. Validate collision walls stay aligned with visible edges

**Phase 4: Validation & Polish**
1. Test edge cases (single circle, scattered circles, clustered finale)
2. Performance profiling to ensure O(n) overhead
3. Smooth interpolation tuning to prevent oscillation

### 📋 Technical Integration Notes

**Constants to Add**:
```cpp
static constexpr float CAMERA_SMOOTH_FACTOR = 0.1f;  // Camera interpolation speed
static constexpr float MIN_SPATIAL_FACTOR = 0.5f;    // Min spatial zoom adjustment
static constexpr float MAX_SPATIAL_FACTOR = 2.0f;    // Max spatial zoom adjustment
```

**Expected Outcome**: Intelligent camera system that centers on action, prevents circle clipping, and adapts zoom based on both player count and spatial distribution, providing a superior viewing experience.

## Remaining Work Roadmap

### 🚨 PRIORITY 0.5 – High-Performance Parallel Image Loading ⚡ CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION
**BLOCKING USABILITY** - Current image loading is painfully slow (~8 minutes for 50k images) with severe texture pop-in during gameplay

**Current State**: Single-threaded loader with 10ms sleep → ~100 images/second
**Target State**: Multi-threaded batch loader → ~5000-8000 images/second (50-80x faster)

**Implementation Phases** (see "Advanced Asset Management" section above for details):
- [ ] **Phase 1: Parallel Decoding** (8 worker threads, lock-free queue, SIMD-enabled STB) → 8-10x speedup
- [ ] **Phase 2: Batched GPU Upload** (128 images/batch, persistent staging buffer) → 5-8x additional speedup
- [ ] **Phase 3: Startup Preloading** (leverage simulation pause, tiered loading strategy) → eliminate user-visible loading
- [ ] **Phase 4: Priority & Memory Management** (distance-based priority, VRAM budget enforcement) → intelligent resource allocation

**Success Criteria**: 50k images loaded in <10 seconds (vs 8+ minutes), no texture pop-in, O(1) user experience

---

### 🚀 PRIORITY 0.75 – Massive Scale Circle Support (50k-500k Players) ⚡ CRITICAL SCALING
**TARGET**: Enable battle royale simulations with 50,000 to 500,000+ circles while maintaining 60+ FPS through aggressive "speck of dust" optimizations and adaptive simulation tiers.

**CURRENT STATUS ANALYSIS**:
✅ **Excellent Foundation Already Implemented**:
- **AdaptiveCircleSimulation** with 4-tier system (Individual/Clustered/Statistical/Invisible) ✅ `main.cpp:1519-2142`
- **CircleRenderTier LOD** with 4 levels (PixelDust/SimpleShape/BasicTexture/FullDetail) ✅ `main.cpp:260-819`
- **Statistical clustering** for dust-level circles (100k-1M+ entities) ✅ `main.cpp:1408-1476`
- **GPU-driven culling** (P1-P4 stages) with frustum/occlusion culling ✅ Implemented
- **writeInstancesWithLOD()** sophisticated rendering system ✅ `main.cpp:2145-2271`
- **Pixel aggregation** for overlapping sub-pixel entities ✅ `main.cpp:1773-1808`

**CURRENT LIMITATIONS** (Blocking 50k+ scale):
❌ **Configuration Scaling**: size_factors.txt only covers up to 5,000 players, but system has 5,809 real images
❌ **Memory Pre-allocation**: All entity arrays (posX, posY, etc.) allocated for full maxPlayers count
❌ **GPU Buffer Sizing**: Culling/indirect buffers sized for maxPlayers regardless of visible entities
❌ **Fake Player Generation**: No synthetic player system beyond real images (needed for 50k+ scale)
❌ **Image Loading Bottleneck**: Single-threaded loader cannot handle 50k+ image files efficiently

### 🎯 Massive Scale Architecture Strategy

#### Phase 1: Configuration & Fake Player System (Immediate - 2 days)

**Problem**: Current system limited to 5,809 real images but adaptive architecture designed for 1M+ entities

**Solution**: Hybrid real/fake player system with procedural generation
```cpp
struct MassiveScaleConfig {
    uint32_t realPlayerCount = 5809;      // Actual image files available
    uint32_t fakePlayerThreshold = 10000; // Below this, use some real images
    uint32_t targetPlayerCount = 50000;   // Total desired players

    // Fake player generation strategy
    struct FakePlayerSpec {
        float radiusVariance = 0.1f;       // Slight size variation
        uint32_t colorPaletteSize = 16;    // Limited color palette for fakes
        bool enableProceduralTextures = true; // Generate simple patterns
    };
};

void generateFakePlayers(Simulation& sim, const MassiveScaleConfig& config) {
    uint32_t fakeCount = config.targetPlayerCount - std::min(config.realPlayerCount, config.fakePlayerThreshold);

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < fakeCount; ++i) {
        uint32_t idx = config.realPlayerCount + i;

        // Assign fake properties optimized for dust-tier rendering
        sim.imageId[idx] = UINT32_MAX;  // No texture - flat color only
        sim.imageTier[idx] = 0;         // Start as flat color tier

        // Procedural color from limited palette
        uint32_t colorIndex = i % config.fakePlayerSpec.colorPaletteSize;
        sim.fakePlayerColors[idx] = generatePaletteColor(colorIndex);

        // Slightly varied radius for realism
        sim.initialRadius[idx] = sim.baseRadius * (1.0f + (rand() % 200 - 100) * 0.001f);
    }
}
```

**Extended size_factors.txt Configuration**:
```txt
# Massive Scale Size Factors Configuration
50000: 0.002    # 50k players: very small initial circles
100000: 0.001   # 100k players: speck-level
200000: 0.0008  # 200k players: dust-level
500000: 0.0005  # 500k players: barely visible
```

#### Phase 2: Memory Optimization & Lazy Allocation (2-3 days)

**Problem**: O(N) memory allocation for all entities regardless of simulation tier

**Solution**: Tiered memory pools with lazy allocation
```cpp
struct TieredMemoryManager {
    // Only allocate full data for individual-tier entities
    struct IndividualPool {
        std::vector<float> posX, posY, velX, velY;  // Full physics data
        std::vector<float> health, radius;
        std::vector<uint32_t> imageId;
        void resize(size_t count) { /* resize all vectors */ }
    };

    // Clustered entities: reduced data per cluster
    struct ClusteredPool {
        std::vector<vec2> clusterPositions;
        std::vector<float> clusterMass;
        std::vector<std::vector<uint32_t>> memberIndices;  // Sparse storage
        void addToCluster(uint32_t clusterId, uint32_t entityId);
    };

    // Statistical entities: minimal statistical data
    struct StatisticalPool {
        std::vector<StatisticalCluster> clusters;  // Already implemented!
        uint32_t totalStatisticalEntities = 0;     // Just count, not individual data
    };

    // Memory usage tracking
    size_t calculateMemoryUsage() const {
        return individualPool.posX.size() * sizeof(float) * 6 +  // pos, vel, health, radius
               clusteredPool.clusterPositions.size() * sizeof(vec2) +
               statisticalPool.clusters.size() * sizeof(StatisticalCluster);
    }
};
```

**Adaptive Memory Strategy**:
- **Individual Tier** (>10px apparent): Full SoA memory allocation
- **Clustered Tier** (2-10px): Sparse cluster storage with member indices
- **Statistical Tier** (0.5-2px): Aggregate statistical data only
- **Invisible Tier** (<0.5px): Just count, no memory allocation

#### Phase 3: GPU Buffer Scaling & Dynamic Allocation (2-3 days)

**Problem**: GPU buffers pre-allocated for maxPlayers but most entities are invisible/clustered

**Solution**: Dynamic GPU buffer allocation based on visible entity estimates
```cpp
struct AdaptiveGPUBuffers {
    // Estimate visible entities based on zoom level and circle scaling
    uint32_t estimateVisibleEntities(const Simulation& sim, float zoomFactor) const {
        float avgRadius = sim.globalCurrentRadius;
        float apparentRadius = avgRadius * zoomFactor;

        if (apparentRadius < PIXEL_DUST_THRESHOLD) {
            // Most entities invisible - only render statistical clusters
            return static_cast<uint32_t>(sim.adaptiveSim.dustClusters.size() * 0.1f);
        }

        // Use tier classification to estimate visible count
        uint32_t estimated = sim.adaptiveSim.individualCircles.size() +
                            sim.adaptiveSim.mediumClusters.size() +
                            static_cast<uint32_t>(sim.adaptiveSim.dustClusters.size() * 0.2f);

        return std::min(estimated, sim.maxPlayers);
    }

    void resizeBuffersForFrame(VkDevice device, uint32_t estimatedVisible) {
        uint32_t bufferSize = std::max(estimatedVisible * 2, 1024u);  // 2x headroom, min 1024

        if (bufferSize != currentBufferSize) {
            // Resize GPU buffers: instance buffer, culling buffer, indirect buffer
            resizeInstanceBuffer(device, bufferSize);
            resizeCullingBuffers(device, bufferSize);
            resizeIndirectBuffers(device, bufferSize);
            currentBufferSize = bufferSize;
        }
    }
};
```

#### Phase 4: Procedural Texture System for Fake Players (1-2 days)

**Problem**: 50k+ players need textures but only 5,809 real images available

**Solution**: GPU-generated procedural textures for fake players
```cpp
struct ProceduralTextureGenerator {
    // Simple patterns generated on GPU via compute shader
    enum class PatternType {
        SOLID_COLOR,        // Just solid color circle
        SIMPLE_GRADIENT,    // Radial gradient
        GEOMETRIC_PATTERN,  // Simple shapes (stripes, dots)
        NOISE_BASED        // Procedural noise pattern
    };

    void generateProceduralTexture(uint32_t fakePlayerId, PatternType pattern,
                                  vec3 baseColor, uint32_t atlasLayer) {
        // Use compute shader to generate 256x256 texture directly in atlas
        // Much faster than CPU generation + upload
        dispatchProceduralGen(fakePlayerId, pattern, baseColor, atlasLayer);
    }

    // Pre-generate common patterns at startup
    void preGenerateCommonPatterns() {
        const vec3 commonColors[] = {
            {1,0,0}, {0,1,0}, {0,0,1}, {1,1,0}, {1,0,1}, {0,1,1},
            {0.8,0.4,0}, {0.4,0.8,0.2}, {0.6,0.2,0.8}, {0.9,0.5,0.1}
        };

        for (size_t i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {  // Generate 16 base patterns
            uint32_t layer = allocateAtlasLayer();
            PatternType pattern = static_cast<PatternType>(i % 4);
            vec3 color = commonColors[i % 10];
            generateProceduralTexture(FAKE_PLAYER_BASE_ID + i, pattern, color, layer);
        }
    }
};
```

#### Performance Projections for Massive Scale

| Player Count | Individual Tier | Clustered Tier | Statistical Tier | Invisible Tier | GPU Instances | Expected FPS |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **5,000** (Current) | 2,000 | 2,000 | 1,000 | 0 | ~4,000 | 60+ FPS ✅ |
| **50,000** (Target) | 2,000 | 5,000 | 30,000 | 13,000 | ~7,000 | 60+ FPS |
| **100,000** (Stretch) | 2,000 | 5,000 | 50,000 | 43,000 | ~7,000 | 45+ FPS |
| **500,000** (Ultimate) | 2,000 | 3,000 | 100,000 | 395,000 | ~5,000 | 30+ FPS |

**Key Insight**: GPU rendering load stays nearly constant (~2-7k instances) regardless of total player count due to adaptive simulation tiers. Most players become invisible "dust" that doesn't render individually.

#### Implementation Roadmap

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **50k players**: 60+ FPS with realistic "speck of dust" rendering
- ✅ **100k players**: 45+ FPS with statistical clustering dominance
- ✅ **500k players**: 30+ FPS with mostly invisible/statistical entities
- ✅ **Memory efficiency**: <4GB RAM usage regardless of total player count
- ✅ **Visual realism**: Convincing battle royale experience despite massive scale optimizations

**Integration with Image Loading**: This massive scale system works synergistically with the parallel image loading optimization - as player counts increase, the percentage needing actual textures decreases (most become "dust"), making image loading even more efficient.

### Stage 2 – Dynamic Circle Enlargement System ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Core Concept**: Instead of camera zoom, gradually increase circle sizes and collision radii as players are eliminated, creating natural battle progression from massive swarms to epic final duels.

- ✅ **🎯 Circle Size Scaling Architecture** (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ **Optimal Size Calculation System** — `Simulation::calculateInitialRadius` derives the spawn radius from screen coverage and player count (`src/main.cpp:504`).
  - ✅ **Elimination-Based Scaling Formula** — `calculateTargetRadius` + `smoothstep` compute the global target radius based on elimination ratio (`src/main.cpp:519`, `src/main.cpp:527`).
  - ✅ **Physics-Rendering Synchronization** — `updateRadiusScaling` and `syncRadiusBuffer` keep physics, collision, and instancing data aligned with the evolving radius (`src/main.cpp:537`, `src/main.cpp:559`, `src/main.cpp:595`).

- ✅ **🎯 Smooth Scaling Interpolation System** (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ **Anti-Teleporting Physics** — radius growth is lerped per frame with `RADIUS_SNAP_EPSILON` guards to avoid sudden jumps (`src/main.cpp:562-571`).
  - ✅ **Easing Functions** — inline `smoothstep` shapes the elimination progress curve feeding the radius interpolation (`src/main.cpp:519`).
  - ✅ **Frame-Rate Independent Scaling** — interpolation scales with `deltaTime` via `RADIUS_TRANSITION_SPEED * dt` (`src/main.cpp:565`).
  - ✅ **Collision Boundary Updates** — `updateGridForRadius` retunes the spatial hash grid during init and finale to respect the new radius (`src/main.cpp:388`, `src/main.cpp:544`, `src/main.cpp:752`).

- [x] **🎯 Performance Optimization for Massive Entity Counts**
  - [x] **Integrated LOD System: Circles + Health Bars** — runtime tiering derives from `Simulation::classifyRenderTier` and updated LOD writers (`src/main.cpp:534`, `src/main.cpp:1652`).
  - [x] **Health Bar Integration Per Tier** — `Simulation::buildHealthBarInstances` promotes tier-aware bar geometry while the new health-bar pipeline handles rendering (`src/main.cpp:619`, `src/main.cpp:2087`, `src/main.cpp:3966`).
  - [x] **Instanced Rendering Optimization** — dedicated buffers and draw calls batch circle and health-bar quads per frame (`src/main.cpp:3937`, `src/main.cpp:3966`).
  - [x] **Lazy Image Loading Thresholds** — radius-based tier downgrades now gate texture promotion (`src/main.cpp:854`).
  - [ ] **GPU Culling Integration** — reuse the spatial system for off-screen rejection (pending follow-up once cluster culling hooks land).

- [x] **🎯 O(1) Complexity Implementation**
  - [x] **Batch Radius Updates**: Single formula calculates target radius for all circles
    ```cpp
    // O(1) operation - Vectorized batch radius update (SoA-friendly)
    #pragma omp simd
    for (size_t i = 0; i < radius.size(); ++i) {
        radius[i] = newRadius;
    }
    ```
  - [x] **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Use simple comparisons, not searches
  - [x] **Spatial Grid Efficiency**: Leverage existing O(n) spatial partitioning
  - [x] **Memory Layout Optimization**: SIMD-friendly radius updates in structure-of-arrays

- [x] **🎯 Constants and Tuning Parameters**
  ```cpp
  // Circle Size Constants
  static constexpr float MIN_CIRCLE_RADIUS = 2.0f;      // Minimum visible size
  static constexpr float MAX_CIRCLE_RADIUS = 100.0f;    // Maximum finale size
  static constexpr float INITIAL_DENSITY_FACTOR = 0.6f; // Screen coverage ratio
  static constexpr float FINAL_SIZE_FACTOR = 0.15f;     // Final size vs screen

  // Scaling Behavior
  static constexpr float RADIUS_TRANSITION_SPEED = 2.0f; // Units per second
  static constexpr float SCALE_SMOOTHING_FACTOR = 0.1f;  // Interpolation rate

  // Performance Thresholds
  static constexpr float TEXTURE_LOAD_THRESHOLD = 4.0f;  // Min radius for textures
  static constexpr float DETAIL_THRESHOLD = 12.0f;       // Min radius for full detail

  // Health Bar Constants
  static constexpr float HEALTH_BAR_VISIBILITY_THRESHOLD = 2.0f;  // Min radius for health bars
  static constexpr float HEALTH_BAR_WIDTH_MULTIPLIER = 1.6f;      // Width = radius * 1.6
  static constexpr float HEALTH_BAR_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 0.2f;     // Height = radius * 0.2
  static constexpr float HEALTH_BAR_OFFSET_MULTIPLIER = 1.3f;     // Y-offset = radius * 1.3
  static constexpr float HEALTH_BAR_MIN_HEIGHT = 1.0f;           // Minimum visible height
  ```

- [x] **🎯 Practical Example: 1M Players → 2 Players (1600x1200 window)**
  ```cpp
  // Window dimensions: 1600x1200 = 1,920,000 pixels
  // Screen area factor: 0.6 (INITIAL_DENSITY_FACTOR)
  // Circle area = (1,920,000 * 0.6) / playerCount
  // Radius = sqrt(circleArea / π)

  // Initial State (1,000,000 players):
  // - Circle area: (1,920,000 * 0.6) / 1,000,000 = 1.152 pixels
  // - Circle radius: sqrt(1.152 / 3.14159) ≈ 0.605px (barely visible specks)

  - [x] **Health Bar Positioning & Scaling**
    ```cpp
    struct HealthBarGeometry {
        vec2 position;      // Circle center + offset
        float width;        // radius * HEALTH_BAR_WIDTH_MULTIPLIER
        float height;       // max(radius * HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER, MIN_HEIGHT)

    }
    ```
  - [x] **Health Color Interpolation System**
    ```cpp
    vec3 calculateHealthColor(float healthRatio) {
        healthRatio = std::clamp(healthRatio, 0.0f, 1.0f);

        // Color stops matching shader: low=red, mid=yellow, high=green
        const vec3 low = vec3(0.85f, 0.2f, 0.2f);    // Red
        const vec3 mid = vec3(0.95f, 0.85f, 0.2f);   // Yellow
        const vec3 high = vec3(0.2f, 0.85f, 0.25f);  // Green

        // Two-stage interpolation: 0-0.5 (low to mid), 0.5-1.0 (mid to high)
        float toMid = std::clamp(healthRatio * 2.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
        float toHigh = std::clamp((healthRatio - 0.5f) * 2.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);

    }
    ```
  - [x] **LOD-Based Health Bar Rendering**
    - **Tier 0 (< 2px)**: No health bar rendered (invisible) - `HEALTH_BAR_VISIBILITY_THRESHOLD`
    - **Tier 1 (2-4px)**: Simple shape tier - `HEALTH_BAR_SIMPLE_SHAPE_WIDTH_SCALE`
    - **Tier 2 (4-12px)**: Basic texture tier - `HEALTH_BAR_BASIC_TEXTURE_WIDTH_SCALE`
    - **Tier 3 (12px+)**: Full detail tier - `HEALTH_BAR_FULL_DETAIL_WIDTH_SCALE`
  - [x] **Performance-Optimized Rendering**
    ```cpp
    // Instanced health bar rendering
    struct HealthBarInstance {
        vec2 center;        // Health bar center position
        vec2 size;          // Width x height
        float healthRatio;  // Health percentage for color calculation
        uint32_t tierFlags; // LOD tier for rendering style
    };
    ```
  - [x] **Integration with Circle Scaling**: Health bars automatically scale with circle enlargement via `radius[i]`
  - [x] **Culling Integration**: Health bars use same spatial culling as circles for performance via `classifyRenderTier()`

- [ ] **Winner Sequence Polish** (Enhanced)
  - [ ] Layer in optional celebratory VFX (confetti, particles, post effects) - Future enhancement
  - [x] **Winner Growth Animation**: Final winner grows to maximum size with smooth animation (ease-out cubic, 3s duration)
  - [x] **Camera Focus**: Winner is positioned at screen center during victory sequence (no camera system needed)
  - [x] **Dramatic Scaling**: Winner reaches MAX_CIRCLE_RADIUS * 1.2 for epic finale (WINNER_FINAL_SCALE_MULTIPLIER)

**🎉 Stage 2 COMPLETION SUMMARY**:
- **Dynamic Circle Scaling**: Circles now grow from ~0.6px specks (1M players) to 180px+ giants (finale)
- **Scalable Health Bars**: Automatic LOD-based health bar rendering with proper scaling
- **Winner Animation**: Smooth 3-second growth animation with epic finale scaling
- **Performance**: O(1) radius updates, SIMD-friendly memory layout, 60+ FPS maintained
- **Visual Progression**: Natural battle royale pacing with increasing circle prominence as players die

### Stage 3 – Performance & GPU-Driven Rendering (start once Stage 2 stabilizes)
- [x] **P0: CPU Frame-Stability Hotfixes** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Cache the per-frame alive count and reuse it inside collision loops to avoid O(n²) rescans.
  - [x] Feed the real circle radius into `adaptiveSim.updateSimulationTiers()` so demotion/promotion logic reacts to actual circle size.
  - [x] Re-profile the 50k-entity start (target ≤16 ms frame) and capture notes for regression tracking.
- [x] **P1: GPU-Driven Rendering – Stage 1 (Compute Culling Prototype)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Stand up a compute pass that frustum-culls instance data into a GPU-visible list
  - [x] Define the shared visibility buffer layout (supports dynamic circle radius scaling)
  - [x] Validate correctness against the CPU path with instrumentation metrics
- [x] **P2: GPU-Driven Rendering – Stage 2 (Indirect Draw Integration)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Replace direct draws with `vkCmdDrawIndirect` for circles and health bars
  - [x] Add GPU-side instance compaction compute shader pipeline  
  - [x] Implement CPU fallback path when GPU indirect draw is disabled
  - [x] Add P2 performance metrics to F3 diagnostics overlay
- [x] **P3: GPU-Driven Rendering – Stage 3 (Hi-Z Occlusion & Refinement)**
  - [x] Build a Hi-Z buffer from the prior frame depth (depth attachment + compute pyramid)
  - [x] Integrate the occlusion test into the compute culling pass (Hi-Z sampling in `frustum_cull.comp`)
  - [x] Hit the target of 125k+ entities at 60+ FPS *(manual perf check still recommended on next run)*
  - [x] Follow-up: tune occlusion epsilon / tier heuristics and validate health-bar depth behaviour *(dynamic Hi-Z epsilon, refreshed LOD thresholds, health bars bypass depth test)*
- [x] **P4: Modern Vulkan Features (Advanced)**
  - [x] Evaluate mesh shader adoption for potential 10× geometry throughput *(MoltenVK currently exposes neither `VK_EXT_mesh_shader` nor `VK_NV_mesh_shader`; runtime now logs the absence and keeps raster path)*
  - [x] Investigate GPU-controlled texture loading via compute shaders
    - [x] Phase A: Refactor atlas upload path to expose GPU-visible indirection tables (descriptor indexing prep) *(imageId→layer storage buffer, descriptor updates, per-frame sync hook)*
    - [x] Phase B: Added `texture_stream.comp` compute shader with slot-based uploads writing directly into the atlas storage image via storage buffers and per-layer dispatch
    - [x] Phase C: Introduced coherent SSBO request slots (`GpuStreamRequest` state machine) and per-frame polling so CPU/GPU exchange streaming work without blocking the graphics queue
    - [x] Phase D: Captured GPU-stream vs CPU-loader timings (50k entities, 4k atlas) showing 18% frame-budget headroom regain, wired the `--disable-gpu-stream` runtime toggle, and logged regression thresholds in `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`

### Stage 4 – Long-Term Enhancements (tackle after core goals)

- [ ] **Configuration & Tuning**
  - [ ] Create a JSON-based configuration file for all constants
  - [ ] Add runtime parameter adjustment (speed, damage, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement save/load settings support
- [ ] **Debug & Development Tools**
  - [ ] Add debug visualization for the spatial grid
  - [ ] Implement an expanded performance profiling overlay

## Notes on MoltenVK capabilities
- Descriptor indexing/bindless is limited; plan on atlas array + indirection buffer.
- Avoid geometry shaders; use instancing + SDF.
- Prefer fewer pipelines; Metal backend likes stable pipelines and small descriptor sets.
