# BattleRoyale Circles - Implementation Plan (Vulkan C++ on macOS / MoltenVK)

## Goals
- Vulkan + GLFW app on macOS (MoltenVK) rendering a simulation of image-backed circles (“players”).
- Bouncing physics with circle-circle and circle-wall collisions; health bars; eliminations.
- Winner sequence: last circle centers, scales up, shows filename as name.
- Massive player counts (up to MAX_PLAYER, with fake circles) and lazy image loading using a visibility threshold.
- Display HUD text: "Players left: X" top-left.
- Robustness: avoid segfaults, races; handle edge cases and large N efficiently.

## macOS Vulkan specifics
- Use loader + MoltenVK. Enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` on instance and set `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR`.
- Enable device extension `VK_KHR_portability_subset` and `VK_KHR_swapchain`.
- Validation layer `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` in debug builds.

## High-level Architecture
- App: window, Vulkan context (instance, device, queues, swapchain, render pass, frame sync, descriptor pools).
- Renderer: draw pass for circles, health bars, and text (HUD). Prefer one pipeline for sprites/billboards, instanced.
- Simulation: ECS-lite structs with SoA for hot loops (positions, velocities, radii, health, alive flags, imageId, bias).
- Asset system: image manager with lazy load tiers (fake -> placeholder -> real). O(1) lookup by player index; avoid per-frame traversal costs.
- Collision system: uniform spatial hash grid (or multi-level grids for varied radii). Broad-phase via grid buckets; narrow-phase exact tests. Deterministic resolution order to avoid races.
- Scheduler: single-threaded simulation step; async I/O for image decode/loading. Thread-safe queues with double buffers to apply asset state updates.

## Massive Scale Strategy (>500k files) + Performance Optimization

### GPU-Driven Rendering Architecture (2024 State-of-Art)
- **Compute Shader Culling**: Offload frustum, distance, and occlusion culling to GPU compute shaders
- **Indirect Drawing**: Use `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect` with GPU-generated command buffers to eliminate CPU draw call overhead
- **Performance Target**: Real-world 125k objects at 290 FPS rendering 40M+ triangles (RTX 2080 benchmark)

### Multi-Level Optimization Strategy
1. **GPU Culling Pipeline**: Compute shaders perform frustum culling, reducing CPU load exponentially
2. **Hierarchical LOD**: GPU-based distance culling with multiple detail levels based on effective viewport size
3. **Occlusion Culling**: Hi-Z buffer technique using previous frame depth for visibility testing
4. **Mesh Shaders**: Modern Vulkan mesh shaders for 10x geometry pipeline performance improvement

### Spatial Partitioning for Collision Performance
- **Hybrid Spatial Structure**: Quadtree for 2D spatial queries + optimized hash grid for collision detection
- **Performance Scaling**: Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n) for clustered objects
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Efficient add/remove operations as entities move and get eliminated

### Data-Oriented Memory Layout (ECS-Inspired)
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)**: Separate arrays for position, velocity, health, alive flags for cache efficiency
- **SIMD-Friendly Processing**: Contiguous memory layout enables vectorized operations on multiple entities
- **Memory Coherence**: Related data stored together to minimize cache misses during hot loops

### Advanced Asset Management
- Do not load all images or create 500k Vulkan image views. Maintain metadata list of file paths and a small LRU cache of decoded + GPU-resident textures (e.g., few thousands max).
- Use a texture atlas array (array of 2D layers) of fixed layer count (e.g., 2048) for visible, above-threshold players. Evict via LRU when layers are scarce. Index via `imageId -> layerIndex | placeholder`.
- If descriptor indexing (bindless) is absent or limited on MoltenVK, prefer a small set of per-frame descriptor sets for the atlas array; use an indirection buffer mapping instance to atlas layer.
- **GPU-Controlled Loading**: Compute shaders determine which textures to load based on visibility thresholds
- Lazy tiers:
  - Tier 0 (fake): no file I/O; rendered as flat color in compute/fragment; guaranteed to die before threshold.
  - Tier 1 (placeholder): tiny 1x1 or 4x4 texture (low memory) for small-but-visible sprites.
  - Tier 2 (real): high-quality mipmapped texture uploaded on demand when radius > IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD.
- O(1) algorithmic constraint for image access: each entity holds stable index to metadata; atlas layer lookup is O(1) via a dense vector; LRU updates are O(1) amortized with linked-list + hashmap.

### Performance Monitoring & Adaptive Quality
- **Real-time Profiling**: Monitor frame time, draw calls, and memory usage
- **Adaptive LOD**: Dynamically adjust IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD based on performance headroom
- **Quality Scaling**: Reduce texture resolution, disable effects when frame rate drops below target

## Rendering Approach
- Instanced rendering of quads (two triangles) for circles; circle appearance via fragment shader signed distance function to avoid per-vertex circles. Image sampled using per-instance atlas layer; health bar drawn as a second instanced pass or in same shader via a screen-space overlay.
- One command buffer per frame, one draw for circles (instanced), one draw for health bars, one draw for text.
- Push constants or storage buffer for per-frame params (time, viewport, scaling factor, thresholds, counts).

## Scaling Visual Size Without Resizing Massive Counts
- **DEPRECATED APPROACH**: Global scale factor applied to radius causes physics-rendering mismatch and collision issues.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Camera/viewport scaling approach - adjust effective viewport dimensions rather than object sizes.
- Only when an instance crosses IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD do we request real texture; below threshold we render flat color/placeholder.

## Physics and Collisions
- Time step: fixed dt (e.g., 1/120s) using accumulator; decouple from render rate.
- Spatial hash grid with cell size ~= average diameter of common radius tier. For high variance, consider multi-grid (e.g., powers of two radii bins).
- Insert alive circles into grid per frame (SoA helps). Broad-phase: only test against items in same and neighboring cells (9 cells).
- Elastic collision response with damping; apply health damage based on impulse magnitude. Clamp minimum damage to ensure progress.
- Wall collisions via AABB checks; invert velocity component and apply small damping.
- Deterministic iteration order (by index) and atomic-free single-threaded physics step to avoid races. Optionally parallelize by tiling grid regions if needed later with careful conflict management.

## Elimination and Winner Flow
- When health <= 0: mark dead, remove from grid, free/evict texture layer (decrement refcount), decrement alive count.
- Winner: when alive count == 1, transition to "victory" state: interpolate position to center, scale up to WINNER_SCALE, display name (filename stem) in center. Freeze others.

## File/IO and Bias
- Enumerate image filenames from `assets/` once; store stems as player names; maintain mapping for bias damage reduction values (config file `bias.txt` or hardcoded map, modifiable at runtime).
- Bias system: players with bias values get damage reduction (not health/size changes). Applied as: `finalDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f - biasReduction)`.
- Bias only active when player count >= BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default 50) to prevent obvious advantages in small battles.
- MAX_PLAYER: if actual image files < MAX_PLAYER, spawn fake circles to reach MAX_PLAYER; fake circles have Tier 0 textures/colors.

## Constants (tunable)
- MAX_PLAYER
- IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD_RADIUS
- MAX_CIRCLE_SIZE
- WINNER_SCALE
- DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER, WALL_DAMPING, COLLISION_DAMPING
- GRID_CELL_SIZE
- BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default: 50 - minimum player count for bias to be active)

## Robustness and Edge Cases
- Validation layers in debug; check all Vk results; RAII wrappers to prevent leaks.
- Guard zero devices/queues/swapchain formats; handle window resize.
- Clamp velocities/radii; avoid NaNs; ensure no division by zero in collision math.
- Thread safety: image loader thread communicates via lock-free MPMC queue or mutex-protected queue; main thread consumes at frame boundary.
- Prevent thundering herd on texture loads: coalesce requests; deduplicate per imageId; cancel when entity dies.

## Text Rendering (Players left)
- Simple path: bake minimal bitmap font (e.g., stb_easy_font) to a dynamic vertex buffer, or integrate Dear ImGui for HUD (no heavy styling). Keep draw order last.

## 🎉 Image Avatar Loading System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The battle royale simulation now successfully runs with the new image avatar loading system! All major components have been implemented and are operational:

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Texture Atlas Array**: 2048-layer 256x256 texture atlas for efficient GPU storage
- **LRU Cache System**: Efficient texture management with automatic eviction when atlas fills
- **Lazy Loading Tiers**:
  - Tier 0: Flat color (fake circles with small radius)
  - Tier 1: Placeholder textures
  - Tier 2: Real images (loaded when radius ≥ 20px threshold)

### ✅ Image Pipeline
- **STB Image Integration**: Background loading of JPEG/PNG files from assets/ directory
- **Multi-threaded Loading**: Background thread for image decoding without blocking simulation
- **Vulkan Upload System**: Proper memory management and image state transitions
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Images automatically resized to 256x256 atlas slots as needed

### ✅ Rendering Integration
- **Updated Shaders**: Support for texture sampling with health color blending
- **Descriptor Sets**: Proper Vulkan binding of texture atlas to shaders
- **Instance Data**: Extended vertex attributes for image layer indexing
- **Visual Feedback**: Health-based color tinting over loaded textures

### ✅ Performance Features
- **O(1) Atlas Lookup**: Hash-based image ID to atlas layer mapping
- **Efficient Eviction**: LRU-based texture replacement when atlas capacity reached
- **Threshold-based Loading**: Only load high-quality textures for large enough circles
- **Memory Management**: Proper staging buffers and resource cleanup

The system supports rendering image avatars for battle royale circles while maintaining high performance through lazy loading and efficient GPU memory usage. Circles start as flat colors and upgrade to real image textures when they become large enough to warrant the loading cost.

## 🔄 Dynamic Camera Scaling System - PLAYER COUNT-BASED ZOOM

**DESIGN GOAL**: Seamless camera scaling that makes circles appear larger as player count decreases, with physics remaining unchanged.

### 🎯 Core Concept: Player Count-Driven Camera Zoom

**Visual Effect**:
- **50,000 players**: Camera zoomed out → circles appear small but all visible
- **Decreasing count**: Camera gradually zooms in → circles appear progressively larger
- **Final players**: Camera zoomed in → circles appear large and dramatic
- **Seamless transition**: Viewers perceive circles as "growing" naturally

### 🎮 Implementation Approach: Viewport Scaling with Constraints

**Camera Zoom Factor Calculation**:
```cpp
// Zoom boundaries
static constexpr float MIN_ZOOM_FACTOR = 0.5f;  // Max zoom out (50k players)
static constexpr float MAX_ZOOM_FACTOR = 3.0f;  // Max zoom in (final players)
static constexpr uint32_t MAX_PLAYERS_FOR_MIN_ZOOM = 50000;
static constexpr uint32_t MIN_PLAYERS_FOR_MAX_ZOOM = 1;

float zoomFactor = calculateZoomFromPlayerCount(aliveCount);
vec2 effectiveViewport = realViewport / zoomFactor;
```

**Zoom Calculation Logic**:
- **High player count** (≥50k): Minimum zoom factor (0.5x) → maximum world area visible
- **Low player count** (≤1): Maximum zoom factor (3.0x) → minimum world area visible
- **Between counts**: Smooth interpolation for seamless scaling experience
- **Bounded range**: Min/max constraints prevent extreme zoom levels

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

**Vertex Shader Modification**:
- Replace `pc.viewport` with `pc.effectiveViewport` in world-to-NDC conversion
- Physics world space remains unchanged at fixed 800x600 dimensions
- Collision walls stay at original `worldWidth/worldHeight` boundaries

**Push Constants Update**:
```cpp
struct PushConstants {
    vec2 effectiveViewport;  // Scaled viewport for zoom effect
    // Physics uses original worldWidth/worldHeight unchanged
};
```

**Collision System**:
- **Wall boundaries must scale** - collision walls need to match visible viewport area
- **Effective world boundaries**: `effectiveWorldWidth/Height = worldWidth/Height / zoomFactor`
- Circle physics continues at 40px radius with existing collision detection
- Spatial grid dimensions scale with effective world size for consistency

### ✨ Key Advantages

**Visual Benefits**:
- Circles appear to "grow" as battle progresses toward finale
- Smooth, cinematic zoom effect enhances drama
- No jarring scale jumps - continuous interpolation

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Consistent collision boundaries** - walls match visible screen edges
- **O(1) performance** - single calculation per frame for zoom factor
- **Proper viewport-collision alignment** - no invisible wall bouncing
- **Industry standard approach** - camera scaling with matched collision boundaries

**Constraint Benefits**:
- **Minimum zoom** prevents over-zooming with massive player counts
- **Maximum zoom** prevents excessive close-up with few players
- **Bounded experience** ensures consistent visual quality range

### 🎯 Implementation Priority

**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:
1. Add zoom factor calculation based on `sim.aliveCount()`
2. Calculate effective world boundaries: `effectiveWorld = worldSize / zoomFactor`
3. Update wall collision detection to use effective boundaries instead of fixed world size
4. Update spatial grid dimensions to match effective world size
5. Modify push constants to send `effectiveViewport` instead of `viewport`
6. Update vertex shader to use effective viewport for world-to-NDC conversion
7. Add min/max zoom factor constants for bounded scaling
8. Test smooth scaling behavior with proper wall collision alignment

**Expected Outcome**: Seamless camera zoom where circles appear to grow as the battle progresses, with collision walls properly aligned to visible screen edges, maintaining consistent 40px circle physics.

## Notes on MoltenVK capabilities
- Descriptor indexing/bindless is limited; plan on atlas array + indirection buffer.
- Avoid geometry shaders; use instancing + SDF.
- Prefer fewer pipelines; Metal backend likes stable pipelines and small descriptor sets.
