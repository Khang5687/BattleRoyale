# BattleRoyale Circles - Implementation Plan (Vulkan C++ on macOS / MoltenVK)

## Goals
- Vulkan + GLFW app on macOS (MoltenVK) rendering a simulation of image-backed circles (“players”).
- Bouncing physics with circle-circle and circle-wall collisions; health bars; eliminations.
- Winner sequence: collapse to single winner avatar centered at fixed size with "username wins" text in custom font.
- Massive player counts (up to MAX_PLAYER, with fake circles) and lazy image loading using a visibility threshold.
- Display HUD text: "Players left: X" top-left.
- Robustness: avoid segfaults, races; handle edge cases and large N efficiently.

## macOS Vulkan specifics
- Use loader + MoltenVK. Enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` on instance and set `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR`.
- Enable device extension `VK_KHR_portability_subset` and `VK_KHR_swapchain`.
- Validation layer `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` in debug builds.

## High-level Architecture
- App: window, Vulkan context (instance, device, queues, swapchain, render pass, frame sync, descriptor pools).
- Renderer: draw pass for circles, health bars, and text (HUD). Prefer one pipeline for sprites/billboards, instanced.
- Simulation: ECS-lite structs with SoA for hot loops (positions, velocities, radii, health, alive flags, imageId, bias).
- Asset system: image manager with lazy load tiers (fake -> placeholder -> real). O(1) lookup by player index; avoid per-frame traversal costs.
- Collision system: uniform spatial hash grid (or multi-level grids for varied radii). Broad-phase via grid buckets; narrow-phase exact tests. Deterministic resolution order to avoid races.
- Scheduler: single-threaded simulation step; async I/O for image decode/loading. Thread-safe queues with double buffers to apply asset state updates.

## Massive Scale Strategy (1M+ Circles) + Circle-Specific Optimizations

### 🎯 **Circle-Optimized Scaling Strategy for 1M+ Entities**

**Core Insight**: When circles become "specks of dust" on screen, exploit visual irrelevance for computational savings through adaptive simulation tiers.

### **Adaptive Simulation Architecture**
```cpp
class AdaptiveCircleSimulation {
    std::vector<Circle> individualCircles;        // <10k: Full simulation
    std::vector<DensityCluster> mediumClusters;   // 10k-100k: Grouped simulation
    std::vector<StatisticalCluster> dustClusters; // 100k-1M: Statistical simulation
};
```

### **Tier-Based Entity Management System**
```cpp
enum CircleSimulationTier {
    INDIVIDUAL,    // >10 pixels: Full circle rendering + physics
    CLUSTERED,     // 2-10 pixels: Group nearby circles into density blobs
    STATISTICAL,   // 0.5-2 pixels: Statistical cluster simulation
    INVISIBLE      // <0.5 pixels: Position tracking only
};
```

### **Performance Scaling Matrix**
| Entity Count | Rendering Method | Physics Method | Expected Performance |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1-1k | Individual circles + SDF | Full collision detection | 120+ FPS |
| 1k-10k | Individual + simple LOD | Spatial grid collision | 60+ FPS |
| 10k-100k | Density clusters | Cluster-to-cluster physics | 30+ FPS |
| 100k-1M+ | Statistical clusters | Statistical approximation | 30+ FPS |

### **Density-Based Rendering Optimization**
```cpp
// Calculate apparent screen size for dynamic detail selection
float apparentRadius = physicalRadius * zoomFactor / distanceFromCamera;

if (apparentRadius < 0.5f) {
    renderAsPixel(averageColor);        // SUB-PIXEL: Single colored pixel
} else if (apparentRadius < 2.0f) {
    renderAsSquare(color);              // TINY: Simple colored square
} else if (apparentRadius < 10.0f) {
    renderAsSimpleCircle(color);        // SMALL: Simplified SDF
} else {
    renderAsDetailedCircle(texture);    // LARGE: Full detail + texture
}
```

### **Statistical Clustering for Dust-Level Circles**
```cpp
struct StatisticalCluster {
    vec2 centerOfMass;          // Cluster position
    float totalMass;            // Combined physics mass
    vec2 averageVelocity;       // Average movement direction
    uint32_t aliveCount;        // Circles in cluster
    vec3 dominantColor;         // Most common circle color

    // Simplified physics: treat cluster as single large circle
    void updatePhysics(float dt);

    // Statistical elimination within cluster
    void processEliminations(float damage);
};
```

### **Dynamic Tier Promotion/Demotion System**
```cpp
void updateSimulationTiers(float currentZoom) {
    // Promote clusters to individuals when zooming in
    for (auto& cluster : dustClusters) {
        if (cluster.getApparentSize(currentZoom) > INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            promoteClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
        }
    }

    // Demote individuals to clusters when zooming out
    for (auto& circle : individualCircles) {
        if (circle.getApparentSize(currentZoom) < CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD) {
            demoteToCluster(circle);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Battle Royale Elimination Cascading**
```cpp
// Natural entity count reduction over time
if (cluster.aliveCount < CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD) {
    // Small clusters break apart into individuals for dramatic finale
    convertClusterToIndividuals(cluster);
}
```

### **Adaptive Performance Thresholds**
```cpp
// Adjust clustering aggressiveness based on performance
if (frameTime > TARGET_FRAME_TIME) {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 1.1f;     // More aggressive clustering
} else {
    DUST_THRESHOLD *= 0.99f;    // More detailed rendering
}
```

### GPU-Driven Rendering Architecture (2024 State-of-Art)
- **Compute Shader Culling**: Offload frustum, distance, and occlusion culling to GPU compute shaders
- **Indirect Drawing**: Use `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect` with GPU-generated command buffers to eliminate CPU draw call overhead
- **Performance Target**: Real-world 125k objects at 290 FPS rendering 40M+ triangles (RTX 2080 benchmark)

### Multi-Level Optimization Strategy
1. **GPU Culling Pipeline**: Compute shaders perform frustum culling, reducing CPU load exponentially
2. **Hierarchical LOD**: GPU-based distance culling with multiple detail levels based on effective viewport size
3. **Occlusion Culling**: Hi-Z buffer technique using previous frame depth for visibility testing
4. **Mesh Shaders**: Modern Vulkan mesh shaders for 10x geometry pipeline performance improvement

### Spatial Partitioning for Collision Performance
- **Hybrid Spatial Structure**: Quadtree for 2D spatial queries + optimized hash grid for collision detection
- **Performance Scaling**: Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n) for clustered objects
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Efficient add/remove operations as entities move and get eliminated

### Data-Oriented Memory Layout (ECS-Inspired)
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)**: Separate arrays for position, velocity, health, alive flags for cache efficiency
- **SIMD-Friendly Processing**: Contiguous memory layout enables vectorized operations on multiple entities
- **Memory Coherence**: Related data stored together to minimize cache misses during hot loops

### Advanced Asset Management
- Do not load all images or create 500k Vulkan image views. Maintain metadata list of file paths and a small LRU cache of decoded + GPU-resident textures (e.g., few thousands max).
- Use a texture atlas array (array of 2D layers) of fixed layer count (e.g., 2048) for visible, above-threshold players. Evict via LRU when layers are scarce. Index via `imageId -> layerIndex | placeholder`.
- If descriptor indexing (bindless) is absent or limited on MoltenVK, prefer a small set of per-frame descriptor sets for the atlas array; use an indirection buffer mapping instance to atlas layer.
- **GPU-Controlled Loading**: Compute shaders determine which textures to load based on visibility thresholds
- Lazy tiers:
  - Tier 0 (fake): no file I/O; rendered as flat color in compute/fragment; guaranteed to die before threshold.
  - Tier 1 (placeholder): tiny 1x1 or 4x4 texture (low memory) for small-but-visible sprites.
  - Tier 2 (real): high-quality mipmapped texture uploaded on demand when radius > IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD.
- O(1) algorithmic constraint for image access: each entity holds stable index to metadata; atlas layer lookup is O(1) via a dense vector; LRU updates are O(1) amortized with linked-list + hashmap.

### Performance Monitoring & Adaptive Quality
- **Real-time Profiling**: Monitor frame time, draw calls, and memory usage
- **Adaptive LOD**: Dynamically adjust IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD based on performance headroom
- **Quality Scaling**: Reduce texture resolution, disable effects when frame rate drops below target

## Rendering Approach
- Instanced rendering of quads (two triangles) for circles; circle appearance via fragment shader signed distance function to avoid per-vertex circles. Image sampled using per-instance atlas layer; health bar drawn as a second instanced pass or in same shader via a screen-space overlay.
- One command buffer per frame, one draw for circles (instanced), one draw for health bars, one draw for text.
- Push constants or storage buffer for per-frame params (time, viewport, scaling factor, thresholds, counts).

## Scaling Visual Size Without Resizing Massive Counts
- **DEPRECATED APPROACH**: Global scale factor applied to radius causes physics-rendering mismatch and collision issues.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Camera/viewport scaling approach - adjust effective viewport dimensions rather than object sizes.
- Only when an instance crosses IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD do we request real texture; below threshold we render flat color/placeholder.

## Physics and Collisions
- Time step: fixed dt (e.g., 1/120s) using accumulator; decouple from render rate.
- Spatial hash grid with cell size ~= average diameter of common radius tier. For high variance, consider multi-grid (e.g., powers of two radii bins).
- Insert alive circles into grid per frame (SoA helps). Broad-phase: only test against items in same and neighboring cells (9 cells).
- Elastic collision response with damping; apply health damage based on impulse magnitude. Clamp minimum damage to ensure progress.
- Wall collisions via AABB checks; invert velocity component and apply small damping.
- Deterministic iteration order (by index) and atomic-free single-threaded physics step to avoid races. Optionally parallelize by tiling grid regions if needed later with careful conflict management.

## Elimination and Winner Flow
- When health <= 0: mark dead, remove from grid, free/evict texture layer (decrement refcount), decrement alive count.
- Winner: when alive count == 1, transition to "victory" state: interpolate position to center, scale up to WINNER_SCALE, display name (filename stem) in center. Freeze others.

## File/IO and Bias
- Enumerate image filenames from `assets/` once; store stems as player names; maintain mapping for bias damage reduction values (config file `bias.txt` or hardcoded map, modifiable at runtime).
- Bias system: players with bias values get damage reduction (not health/size changes). Applied as: `finalDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f - biasReduction)`.
- Bias only active when player count >= BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default 50) to prevent obvious advantages in small battles.
- MAX_PLAYER: if actual image files < MAX_PLAYER, spawn fake circles to reach MAX_PLAYER; fake circles have Tier 0 textures/colors.

## Constants (tunable)
- MAX_PLAYER
- IMAGE_LOAD_THRESHOLD_RADIUS
- MAX_CIRCLE_SIZE
- WINNER_SCALE
- DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER, WALL_DAMPING, COLLISION_DAMPING
- GRID_CELL_SIZE
- BIAS_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD (default: 50 - minimum player count for bias to be active)

### 1M+ Entity Scaling Constants
- INDIVIDUAL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 10.0f - minimum apparent radius for individual simulation)
- CLUSTER_DEMOTION_THRESHOLD (default: 2.0f - maximum apparent radius for cluster demotion)
- DUST_THRESHOLD (default: 0.5f - minimum apparent radius for any rendering)
- CLUSTER_BREAKUP_THRESHOLD (default: 10 - minimum cluster size before breakup)
- MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE (default: 50 - minimum circles needed to form cluster)
- TARGET_FRAME_TIME (default: 16.67ms - 60 FPS target for adaptive thresholds)

## Robustness and Edge Cases
- Validation layers in debug; check all Vk results; RAII wrappers to prevent leaks.
- Guard zero devices/queues/swapchain formats; handle window resize.
- Clamp velocities/radii; avoid NaNs; ensure no division by zero in collision math.
- Thread safety: image loader thread communicates via lock-free MPMC queue or mutex-protected queue; main thread consumes at frame boundary.
- Prevent thundering herd on texture loads: coalesce requests; deduplicate per imageId; cancel when entity dies.

## Text Rendering (Players left)
- Simple path: bake minimal bitmap font (e.g., stb_easy_font) to a dynamic vertex buffer, or integrate Dear ImGui for HUD (no heavy styling). Keep draw order last.

## 🔄 Dynamic Camera Scaling System - PLAYER COUNT-BASED ZOOM

**DESIGN GOAL**: Seamless camera scaling that makes circles appear larger as player count decreases, with physics remaining unchanged.

### 🎯 Core Concept: Player Count-Driven Camera Zoom

**Visual Effect**:
- **50,000 players**: Camera zoomed out → circles appear small but all visible
- **Decreasing count**: Camera gradually zooms in → circles appear progressively larger
- **Final players**: Camera zoomed in → circles appear large and dramatic
- **Seamless transition**: Viewers perceive circles as "growing" naturally

### 🎮 Implementation Approach: Viewport Scaling with Constraints

**Camera Zoom Factor Calculation**:
```cpp
// Zoom boundaries
static constexpr float MIN_ZOOM_FACTOR = 0.5f;  // Max zoom out (50k players)
static constexpr float MAX_ZOOM_FACTOR = 3.0f;  // Max zoom in (final players)
static constexpr uint32_t MAX_PLAYERS_FOR_MIN_ZOOM = 50000;
static constexpr uint32_t MIN_PLAYERS_FOR_MAX_ZOOM = 1;

float zoomFactor = calculateZoomFromPlayerCount(aliveCount);
vec2 effectiveViewport = realViewport / zoomFactor;
```

**Zoom Calculation Logic**:
- **High player count** (≥50k): Minimum zoom factor (0.5x) → maximum world area visible
- **Low player count** (≤1): Maximum zoom factor (3.0x) → minimum world area visible
- **Between counts**: Smooth interpolation for seamless scaling experience
- **Bounded range**: Min/max constraints prevent extreme zoom levels

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

**Vertex Shader Modification**:
- Replace `pc.viewport` with `pc.effectiveViewport` in world-to-NDC conversion
- Physics world space remains unchanged at fixed 800x600 dimensions
- Collision walls stay at original `worldWidth/worldHeight` boundaries

**Push Constants Update**:
```cpp
struct PushConstants {
    vec2 effectiveViewport;  // Scaled viewport for zoom effect
    // Physics uses original worldWidth/worldHeight unchanged
};
```

**Collision System**:
- **Wall boundaries must scale** - collision walls need to match visible viewport area
- **Effective world boundaries**: `effectiveWorldWidth/Height = worldWidth/Height / zoomFactor`
- Circle physics continues at 40px radius with existing collision detection
- Spatial grid dimensions scale with effective world size for consistency

### ✨ Key Advantages

**Visual Benefits**:
- Circles appear to "grow" as battle progresses toward finale
- Smooth, cinematic zoom effect enhances drama
- No jarring scale jumps - continuous interpolation

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Consistent collision boundaries** - walls match visible screen edges
- **O(1) performance** - single calculation per frame for zoom factor
- **Proper viewport-collision alignment** - no invisible wall bouncing
- **Industry standard approach** - camera scaling with matched collision boundaries

**Constraint Benefits**:
- **Minimum zoom** prevents over-zooming with massive player counts
- **Maximum zoom** prevents excessive close-up with few players
- **Bounded experience** ensures consistent visual quality range

### 🎯 Implementation Priority

**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:
1. Add zoom factor calculation based on `sim.aliveCount()`
2. Calculate effective world boundaries: `effectiveWorld = worldSize / zoomFactor`
3. Update wall collision detection to use effective boundaries instead of fixed world size
4. Update spatial grid dimensions to match effective world size
5. Modify push constants to send `effectiveViewport` instead of `viewport`
6. Update vertex shader to use effective viewport for world-to-NDC conversion
7. Add min/max zoom factor constants for bounded scaling
8. Test smooth scaling behavior with proper wall collision alignment

**Expected Outcome**: Seamless camera zoom where circles appear to grow as the battle progresses, with collision walls properly aligned to visible screen edges, maintaining consistent 40px circle physics.

### 📋 Stage 2 Implementation Notes

**Integration with Spatial System**:
- Use `SpatialBounds` APIs from Stage 1 for camera-spatial coordination
- Call `spatialManager.updateWorldBounds(effectiveWorld)` when zoom changes
- Leverage existing spatial grid resizing for performance consistency

**Performance Considerations**:
- Zoom factor calculation is O(1) - single interpolation per frame
- Spatial grid resize only occurs when zoom thresholds crossed (not every frame)
- Use existing performance instrumentation to monitor zoom impact on FPS

**Testing Strategy**:
- Validate collision walls stay aligned with visible screen edges
- Test smooth interpolation across full player count range (1-50k)
- Verify spatial grid efficiency maintained across all zoom levels
- Ensure no physics drift or collision anomalies during zoom transitions

**Future Integration Points**:
- Camera state will feed into Stage 3 GPU culling for viewport frustum
- Zoom factor affects Stage 2 health bar positioning and scaling
- Winner sequence camera focus builds on this zoom foundation

## Notes on MoltenVK capabilities
- Descriptor indexing/bindless is limited; plan on atlas array + indirection buffer.
- Avoid geometry shaders; use instancing + SDF.
- Prefer fewer pipelines; Metal backend likes stable pipelines and small descriptor sets.
